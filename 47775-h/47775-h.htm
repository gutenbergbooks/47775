  <h2 id='serve' class='c009'><span class='large'>CHAPTER ONE</span> <br />Â <br /><span class='large'>THEY ALSO SERVE</span></h2>

<p class='c010'>âOh, Kitty, look!â Little Billy Carter jumped
up and down in delight beside his tall sister.
âThereâs Daddy!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhere?â Kitty asked as she searched the files
of marching troops for a look at her dad.</p>

<p class='c011'>Billy pointed with his chubby finger. âYonder!
The straightest, bestest of all!â</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Kittyâs heart swelled with pride, too, as
she watched a tall man with the other medical
officers from the Naval hospital. They were all
wonderful, those rhythmical, moving lines of blue,
green and khaki, but for the two Carters the heart
and soul of it all was the Chief Pharmacistâs Mate
they called Dad. They were sure the war could never
be won without him.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a gala day in Bayport, for every organization
had turned out to boost the Community Chest
drive. Now a military band was passing, while
Billyâs small feet kept time, and scuffed out the
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>soles of his shoes. Kitty had had no idea a six-year-old
could wear out so many shoes till she had
come home from college a short time ago. Was it
really only a few weeks ago? To Kitty it seemed
ages, for her whole program of life had been
changed in that time.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThere come the WACs, to give Hitler whacks,â
Billy prattled.</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd there are the WAVES, our American
braves.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty laughed though her heart was like stone
as she repeated the silly rhyme she had made up
for Billy at Christmastime when she told him she
was going to join the WAVES. How little she had
dreamed during that happy vacation that Aunt
Nina would be gone in another month, and Billy
would have no one to look to except his big sister.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Kitty couldnât keep back the blinding tears
as the WACs and WAVES passed in their trim
uniforms, their heads held high, their eyes bright
in the knowledge that they were doing their share
to help win the war.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhen are you going to be a WAVE, Kit, and
wear a pretty uniform?â Billy wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâve decided not to be a WAVE, darling,â
Kitty looked straight ahead for fear he would see
her tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut you said you were going to help win the
war. Dad says we all must.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>âLook, there come the tanks!â</p>

<p class='c011'>Billy forgot his puzzlement over his sisterâs
change of plans, for the tanks were followed by
jeeps, trucks and more lines of marching men and
women. At last the parade went on down Bay
Street, but Kitty still stood staring at the moving
stream of passenger cars in its wake, though she
really saw nothing that passed. Somehow she felt
cheated, out of it all. After a while an insistent,
small hand tugging at hers brought her back to
the present.</p>

<p class='c011'>âArenât we going to see the ducks in the park?
You promised.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes, of course. Itâll be fun watching the ducks.
Letâs go across to the bay walk.â</p>

<p class='c011'>They succeeded in crossing the street finally,
and hurried down the path curving around the
bay shore. In sight of the water Kittyâs spirits
always lifted. After all it was for such as Billy
that this war was being fought, that they might
be free to go to parks and feed ducks, and walk
along a bay shore without fear of bombs overhead.
As Dad had said, she was really doing more than
her bit, giving him a start in life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bayshore Park was a lovely spot of green under
magnificent moss-draped live oaks. By the time
they reached it the parade had broken up and
marines, soldiers and sailors were scattered about
the green slopes, resting after their long march.
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>At the duck pond Kitty took a small package of
bread crumbs for the ducks from her purse and
handed them to Billy.</p>

<p class='c011'>As she sat on a bench near by, her attention was
suddenly caught by a group of Canteen workers
serving a lunch to the tired soldiers. There were
young girls in the Corps, some even younger than
she, laughing and talking with the men as they
served them coffee, doughnuts and sandwiches from
a long table under the trees. How hungry the
boys seemed and how appreciative of having some
girls to talk to!</p>

<p class='c011'>Now she recognized one of the girls from near
her home over on Palmetto Island. Why Sally
Bright was still in high school! How could she
get into the Canteen Corps?</p>

<p class='c011'>âLook, Kitty, the sailor made me a boat!â Again
Billyâs voice recalled her from her abstraction.</p>

<p class='c011'>She discovered a young yeoman squatting by the
pond with Billy as they launched a magnolia-leaf
boat, with an oak-leaf sail. Billy was gobbling half
a sandwich the sailor had given him.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou shouldnât have given him your sandwich!â
she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The young man sprang to his feet, apparently
seeing her for the first time.</p>

<p class='c011'>âTheyâre so good,â he explained. âI couldnât
eat with him looking on.â He had brown eyes
that twinkled as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>âThey do look good,â she admitted.</p>

<p class='c011'>âLet me get you one? These Canteen girls sure
have a genius for making sandwiches.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, no, donât bother, please. Iâm not hungry.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâve a kid sister whoâs learned lots about good
food since sheâs been a Canteen worker.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âKid sister?â repeated Kitty, puzzled.</p>

<p class='c011'>He laughed. âWell, sheâs not such a kid after
all, I guess. Junior in college.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHow can she be a Canteen worker and go to
college, too?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, she has plenty of extra time to get in her
Canteen quota of hours. A girl can do Canteen
work anywhere she happens to be living.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, I didnât know that. You mean they donât
have to sign up for full time or go away from
home to do that work?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSure!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh say, why didnât I know about this before?â</p>

<p class='c011'>The sailorâs face grew serious at the desperate
way in which she spoke. âWhy? Would you like
to do Canteen work?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâd like to do anything to help.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWell, gal, nobodyâs keeping you from it!
Thereâs Miss Pearson right over yonder. Iâll introduce
you to her. Heard her say sheâs going to
start a new nutrition class next week.â</p>

<p class='c011'>He caught her hand and started across the green
to the end of the long table where an efficient-looking
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>woman, in a blue uniform with spotless
white collar and cuffs, was pouring coffee. Within
a few feet of her the sailor stopped suddenly.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhat <i>is</i> your name? After all, introductions
are awkward without having the names of both
parties.â</p>

<p class='c011'>They laughed self-consciously.</p>

<p class='c011'>âKathryn CarterâKitty they call me, of course.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm Yeoman Brad Mason.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI knew you were a yeomanâyour crossed
feather insignia,â she told him. âYou see my dadâs
been in the Navy ten years.â</p>

<p class='c011'>His face brightened. âOh, then weâre practically
in the same family. And now that the formalities
are over weâll proceed to business.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty glanced toward the end of the table and
realized that Miss Pearson had overheard their little
conversation. The three of them laughed, and
the ice was completely broken.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSince introductions are now unnecessary, Miss
Pearson,â said Brad, âlet me explain that this
young lady has suddenly discovered thereâs such a
thing in this manâs war as a Canteen Corps.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty flushed. âOh, really now, Iâve always known
about them, but just got the idea of doing that
work myself.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âItâs certainly the duty of everyone to serve
somewhere.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty felt a slight edge on Miss Pearsonâs tone,
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>and was aware that her eyes swept over her smart
sweater suit and the jaunty blue tam.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâve always meant to do my bit the minute I
got my degree,â Kitty hastened to explain. âBut
Iâve thought and dreamed and worked toward
going into the WAVES.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWell, why donât you? Theyâre doing a marvelous
work.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kittyâs eyes wandered to where Billy poked at
his sail boat with a long stick. âI canât go now,â
she said in a low tone. âMy aunt who has taken
care of my little brother since my mother died,
also left us six weeks ago. Dadâs in the service,
and thereâs no one left with Billy but me.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Pearson followed Kittyâs glance to the little
form beside the pond. Her voice was warm with
understanding as she said, âYes, heâs your first responsibility.â
Then she smiled gently as she added,
âBut I know it was hard for you to give up your
dream of being a WAVE.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDonât think Iâm bitter about it,â Kitty hastened
to assure her. âI adore Billy. Heâs worth any sacrifice
I could make. But if I could help somewhere
to hasten the end of this war, nothing would make
me happier.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs certainly <i>our</i> aim.â Miss Pearson
glanced with a comradely look at Brad.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll say!â he agreed heartily.</p>

<p class='c011'>âDo you think I could get into the Canteen
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>Corps? Mr. Mason says you donât have to live
away from home.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOf course, theyâll be delighted to have you, my
dear. Come over to the station wagon, and Iâll
give you some leaflets telling about our work.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWait a minute till I get Billy. Heâll be sure
to fall in the pond if I go out of sight.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou go âlong. Iâll look after Billy,â volunteered
Brad. âI like that boy. Heâs enough like my oldest
sisterâs kid to be his twin.â</p>

<p class='c011'>As they turned toward the station wagon that
had brought over the Canteen supplies, Kitty
began to have misgivings.</p>

<p class='c011'>âMaybe I canât do this sort of thing at all. You
know I majored in music at school.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou like to eat, donât you?â retorted Miss Pearson
in that snappy, business-like way she had.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll say, and cook, too! Itâs one of my hobbies.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWell then, what are you worrying about?â</p>

<p class='c011'>She reached to the car seat and took out a brief
case packed with notebooks and leaflets.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThis little book will tell you what the Canteen
Corps is.â</p>

<p class='c011'>As Kitty took the blue book with the Red Cross
on the cover she exclaimed, âOh, itâs part of the
Red Cross work?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOf course. What did you think it was?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI hadnât thought. This will make it all the
more wonderful, working with the Red Cross. You
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>know I think thatâs the most marvelous organization.
Itâs simply great what they do for anybody,
anywhere.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Pearson smiled at the exaggeration. âWell,
my dear, itâs not quite so comprehensive as that.
But we do stand ready to help in all emergencies,
and thatâs where the Canteen workers play such an
important part. We are ready to feed people after
air raids, storms, floods, and disasters of all kinds.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, that is important!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd we must work under all sorts of handicaps.
We often have to prepare large quantities of food
right out in the open.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI learned something of outdoor cooking in my
Girl Scout work years ago,â said Kitty proudly.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThen you already have a splendid foundation.
Some scouts are helping us this afternoon.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhat must I do to get in? When can I start?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âFirst you must take a course in nutrition. Iâm
starting a new class next Monday morning.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIs the class filled? I hope I can get in.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI already have a full class, but I can make room
for someone like you. You see lots of women take
this course, even when they canât follow it up
with Canteen work.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhen this course is finished may I sign up
for Canteen work?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou have to follow the nutrition course with
a course in Canteen work.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>âWish Iâd started sooner so Iâd be ready for work
now.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThe course may seem long, but thereâs much
more to Canteen work than the foundation course
and emergency feeding. We do so many things.
We often serve refreshments at blood donation
centers. We have Snack Bars in USO halls. Sometimes
our Canteen women help with school lunch
counters or in day nurseries.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThereâs one over on Palmetto Island where
Billy sometimes goes.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSo you live on Palmetto Island? Thatâs all to
the good. Weâre badly in need of workers there.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, Iâm so happy to learn about this! And you
still think I can do it and not neglect my duty to
Billy?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOf course, my dear. We have many mothers
with several children, who manage to keep up
their quota of Canteen hours every year and not
neglect their homes. In fact theyâre better mothers
and homemakers for having taken the courses.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâve got to hug somebodyâyou!â exclaimed
Kitty, impulsively throwing her arms around Miss
Pearson. âItâs so wonderful to find something I
can really do to help.â</p>

<p class='c011'>When Miss Pearson had told her the time and
place of the nutrition class, Kitty hurried back to
Billy, wondering if she would ever have patience
to wait till Monday to begin her training.</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>

  <h2 id='meeting' class='c002'><span class='large'>CHAPTER TWO</span><br />Â <br /><span class='large'>A STRANGE MEETING</span></h2>

<p class='c010'>âWill I be eating sandwiches you made the next
time the Canteen serves here?â Brad Masonâs eyes
twinkled teasingly as he put the question to Kitty
when she returned to the duck pond.</p>

<p class='c011'>âMaybe.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAre you really going to take the Canteen
course?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI wouldnât miss it for worlds! And say, I owe
you a vote of thanks. If you hadnât dropped those
remarks about the Canteen work I might never
have thought of joining.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd what a prize they would have missed!â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty flushed as she took Billyâs hand and told
him it was time to go home. It was strange how
Brad Mason seemed like someone she had always
known.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWait a minute, now!â exclaimed Brad, pretending
to be angry. âYou canât walk out of my life
like this. After all weâve been introduced properly
with Miss Pearson as witness.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty glanced up into his face as she buttoned
Billyâs coat. Then they laughed gayly.</p>

<p class='c011'>âAt least you might tell me where you live,â
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>Brad persisted.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOn Palmetto Island near the hospital. My dad
works there. Heâs a Chief Pharmacistâs Mate.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNot really!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âMaybe you know him, since youâre in the
Navy.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy, were as good as in the same family. I
work in the registrarâs office at the hospital.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty thought he was joking and said so. âI
donât remember ever seeing you there.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBeen on leave for two weeks, and I had a little
sick spell before that.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, then that explains it.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOdd I never saw you before.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI came home from college about a month ago.
Dadâs been down here two months.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYeah, I know him well. Heâs tops!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe think so, donât we, Billy?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou bet! Heâs the bravest man in the whole
Navy.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty made a move to leave the park, but Brad
followed.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI didnât parade. I got into town only today.
Couldnât I ride the bus back to the island with
you?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI came in our launch. I have to wait and meet
someone who is coming in on the four-thirty train.
But say, if youâre not in a hurry weâd be glad to
have you ride back across the bay with us. Thereâs
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>plenty of room.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâll be swell.â</p>

<p class='c011'>The town busses were so packed with people
going home from the parade they decided to walk
to the railroad station as it was only a few blocks
down the street. When Billy got too tired Brad
took him astride his shoulders and didnât seem to
care a bit if anyone stared at him.</p>

<p class='c011'>âGoing to meet some girl friend?â he asked
when they were in sight of the station.</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo, a new nurse is coming to the hospital. I
think she has worked in some hospital with Dad
before. He knew all the island busses would be
jammed after the parade, so suggested I come over
in the launch and bring her back.â</p>

<p class='c011'>As Kitty had never seen Hazel Dawson she was
a little uneasy for fear she would slip through the
train gates unrecognized. There were several smartly
uniformed women among the travelers, WACs,
and WAVES and Women Marines. Most of them
hurried by as if familiar with the station and town.
Then she saw a brisk-looking Navy nurse, following
a redcap loaded with bags. Kitty was still
hesitating when the nurse paused suddenly and
looked her straight in the face.</p>

<p class='c011'>âAreâare youâ?â Kitty began.</p>

<p class='c011'>She got no further when the nurse exclaimed,
âWhy you must be Kitty Carter, or her duplicate.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThen you <i>are</i> Miss Dawson?â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>âNo other. But I didnât expect anyone to meet
me.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty explained about the parade and the
crowded busses, then introduced Brad and Billy.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThis really is an honor. It seems almost like
going home to have someone meet me,â said Miss
Dawson happily.</p>

<p class='c011'>They caught a taxi outside the station. After
the flurry of seeing about baggage Hazel Dawson
seemed tired as she settled back in the car seat.
Kitty glanced fleetingly at her face to see a weary,
worried expression in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>âTired?â she asked sympathetically. Somehow
she felt strangely drawn to this older woman. She
judged Ensign Dawson to be somewhere in her
thirties. Evidently she had already seen real action.
On her coat she wore the yellow ribbon for South
Pacific service, and two stars indicating she had
been in two major engagements. Her eyes held the
shadowed, yet kindly light of one who eased much
suffering.</p>

<p class='c011'>âNot too tired,â she replied to Kittyâs question
as she forced a smile to her lips. She studied the
girlâs face thoughtfully a moment before she added,
âSo youâre Kitty Carter.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThey say I look like Dad.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou do. I had no trouble recognizing you.
Wherever your dad is he always keeps your picture
and Billyâs on his desk.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>âSo youâve served with him before?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe worked together several months in the
Pacific, and were in the same hospital at Annapolis.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI didnât visit Dad when he was at Annapolis.
You see ever since the war began Iâve been cramming,
winter and summer, to get my degree. I
wanted to get through as soon as I could and join
the WAVES.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes. Your father told the you had to change
your plans.â Hazel sent an understanding glance
toward Billy, sitting on Bradâs lap.</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut Iâm going to be able to help after all,â
said Kitty eagerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>âReally? Then youâve made arrangements for
the boy?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh no. I can help and still keep our little
home. Iâm going into Canteen work.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs splendid!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI might never have thought of it if I hadnât
met Brad Mason today.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, you only met today.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Brad grinned boyishly. âI thought it was important
to get acquainted with her, even if I did have
to use Billy as a go-between.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBilly as a go-between!â exclaimed Kitty, shocked.
âDo you mean you made that sailboat for him
with an ulterior motive?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll have to plead guilty!â But Bradâs hearty
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>laugh betrayed no sense of guilt. âWhen I saw you
sitting on that bench looking so pensive I said to
myself, âNow thereâs a pretty girl who needs cheering.ââ</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd we women have the idea itâs the service
men who need cheering,â said Hazel.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty laughed in spite of her chagrin. âWell. Iâll
have to hand it to you for being a cheerer-upper,â
she admitted.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHow did he stir up your interest in Canteen
work?â asked Hazel, entering gayly into their
banter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty gave a sprightly account of their meeting,
and ended by saying. âAnd before I knew what
had happened I had practically joined the Canteen
Corps and invited Brad to ride home with us.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut you can bet she wouldnât have done it if
you hadnât been coming along. I know Kittyâs
kind. Sheâs a stickler for form.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, not really!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âJust the same itâll do you no end of good being
a Canteen worker,â Brad persisted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty was about to make a saucy retort when
Billy piped up. âLook, Kit, thereâs the Red Cross
station wagon!â</p>

<p class='c011'>Sure enough they were passing the park where
the station wagon was being loaded again. Miss
Pearson glanced her way and waved.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI think sheâs going to be nice to work with,â
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>said Kitty happily. âI can hardly wait till Monday
to begin my training.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âCan I ride in the station wagon with you when
youâre a Canteen worker?â Billy wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIf theyâll let you.â</p>

<p class='c011'>At the corner where they had to turn toward the
docks, the taxi was held up by traffic. A crowded
Palmetto Island bus in front of them was loading
passengers. A dozen or more people couldnât get on
at all. Among them Kitty noticed Lieutenant Cary,
one of the physicians from their own hospital. It
seemed a shame to leave him to wait for the next
bus when there was plenty of room in their launch.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the taxi crept through the traffic near the
spot where the young lieutenant stood, she called
out to him, âCome down to the dock.â She pointed
down the side street toward the bay. âWeâll give
you a ride over to the island in our launch.â</p>

<p class='c011'>He acknowledged her invitation with a dignified
bow. When they moved on Kitty turned to Brad
and said, âSeemed a shame not to pick him up.
You know him of courseâLieutenant Cary?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, yes.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty was surprised to find Bradâs cool tone reflecting
some of her own instinctive dislike of the
man. She tried to disregard the feeling for she
scarcely knew Lieutenant Cary. She had encountered
him only a few times in her fatherâs office at the
hospital. Though he made obvious efforts to be
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>friendly Kitty had an unaccountable aversion for
him. But she could not let her ungrounded prejudice
go so far as to make her pass by one of her
fatherâs co-workers, when she had plenty of room
to take him home. Transportation conditions were
bad enough, without anyone traveling with unused
space.</p>

<p class='c011'>Brad was most helpful in loading Hazelâs suitcases
into the launch. By the time they had loaded
the launch and warmed the motor, Lieutenant Cary
came sprinting toward them. Brad and Miss Dawson
saluted their superior officer as the physician
paused a moment on the dock.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThis is really kind of you, Miss Carter,â Cary
said, stepping into the launch. âI had no idea
thereâd be such a traffic jam when I came over.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âMiss Dawson, may I present Lieutenant Cary?â
said Kitty, while Cary still stood beside her in the
middle of the launch.</p>

<p class='c011'>He bowed with what Kitty thought exaggerated
formality under the cramped conditions. âYouâre
the new nurse scheduled to begin work tomorrow,
I presume?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThat is correct, Lieutenant Cary.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty felt as if icy spray had been dashed into
her face at the coolness of the tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâre no relation of Mate Willard Dawson, I
presume?â questioned the Lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm proud to say heâs my brother!â Hazel Dawson
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>spoke the words almost with defiance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty, standing between the two wondered what
all this meant. Their antagonistic attitude was
most unaccountable. She glanced at Brad to find
a strained, embarrassed look on his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty deliberately raced the engine to end the
awkward moment. As she slowly and skillfully
steered the launch through the harbor traffic, she
wondered what all this meant. Who was this mysterious
Willard Dawson, and why should Hazel be
so stiff-necked in her assertion that he was her
brother? Fortunately Hazel was in the prow, while
Lieutenant Cary sat in the stern with Brad. Billy
always wanted to stand in the prow, so Nurse Dawson
kept a protecting arm around him while Kitty
ran the boat.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kittyâs father had said many times that she had
been born with the salt of the sea in her veins, like
all the Carters. Two generations of naval officers
had been preceded by a great-grandfather who was
captain of his own sailing vessel, so Kitty had only
been following the family tradition when she aspired
toward the WAVES. But she decided that
afternoon as she headed back toward Palmetto
Island that serving the Canteen was the perfect
substitute under the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c011'>The noise of the motor made conversation difficult,
and she was rather glad of it, for the afternoon
had been so eventful she had much to think about.
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>First and foremost was her delight in making a
service link. And meeting Bradâthat was something
she would never forget! And Hazel Dawson,
too. She sensed it was the beginning of a new and
different sort of friendship. She wondered why the
thought of Dr. Cary chilled her ardor. Did Brad
know why these two seemed to freeze on meeting?
She meant to ask him when she had a chance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hazel caught her attention, waving toward the
receding shores. âBeautiful countryâmarvelous!â
she exclaimed, above the noise of the motor.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâll love it here.â Kitty told her. âIâll take
you boat riding, even if we have to row to save
gas. You must see these intriguing marshes, and
the beautiful shore lines with the wonderful live
oaks draped in Spanish moss.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThis is my first trip south, in my own country,â
Hazel told her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Palmetto Island now came into view with its
many smokestacks marking the sky line. A fringe
of palmettoes farther east was lost in the mists
where the inland waterways met the sea. Kitty
pointed to the western shore where a large white
building stood on the point.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThereâs the Bernard General Hospital,â she
said to Hazel. âOur house isnât far away, and the
Marine Base is farther east and south.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âA lovely spot!â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty thought she caught a wistful note in
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>Hazelâs voice, and her eyes were almost sad as she
drank in the beauty of green marshes, the blue sky,
and the bluer sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>On reaching the island docks Kitty phoned her
father as they had previously arranged to send
down a car. When she came out of the warehouse
where she had used the phone, Lieutenant Cary
was gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe could have taken him up with us,â she
said, embarrassed that she had failed to invite him
specifically before she had gone to phone her
father.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe said he had to stop on the way up to see a
friend,â Brad explained. âHe left his thanks to you
for giving him a lift.â Then to Kittyâs amazement
Brad added in a low tone through almost closed
teeth, âGood riddance, if you ask me!â</p>

<p class='c011'>That night at supper Kitty gave her father an
account of her unusual afternoon, the main point
of which was to tell him she wanted to begin
Canteen training.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm proud of you, Kitty, that you wouldnât
give up till you found some way you could serve
under the circumstances,â said her father.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThen you do think I can do it?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOf course. Thereâs nothing to prevent it.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWeâll have to pay Jane extra to stay with Billy
the nights Iâm on duty. Can we afford that?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âCertainly, my dear. Iâve been thinking we might
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>fix up that room behind the kitchen so Jane can
be here all the time.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs a swell idea, Dad. Iâd think sheâd be
glad to have a place rent free. Last week she had
to borrow money to pay her rent.â</p>

<p class='c011'>They talked over further details of the new arrangement
for their combination nurse and cook.
But even while they discussed their domestic problems
Kittyâs mind kept going back to the meeting
between Lieutenant Cary and Ensign Dawson.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finally she blurted out, âDad, did you ever
know Willard Dawson, Hazelâs brother?â</p>

<p class='c011'>He glanced at her sharply. âNo, he left before
I came. I was sent to take his place.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThen he worked a while with Lieutenant
Cary?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOf course. Cary has been here six months.
But why do you ask?â</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Kitty attempted to give him an account
of the meeting on the launch, and the animosity
she felt existed between the two strangers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father tried to brush her suspicions aside.
âYou mustnât get the habit of attributing motives
to every little thing people do, Kitty. Often people
are merely tired or preoccupied, and their coolness
has no significance at all.â</p>

<p class='c011'>But Kitty was not satisfied with this explanation.
She felt that her father knew much more about the
mysterious Willard Dawson than he had revealed.</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>

<div>  <span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span></div>
  <h2 id='usoparty' class='c002'><span class='large'>CHAPTER THREE</span><br />Â <br /><span class='large'>THE USO PARTY</span></h2>

<p class='c010'>All the next day, though Kitty had many obligations
and numerous things on her mind, her
thoughts continually returned to the peculiar circumstances
of her boat ride from town. There was
something very mysterious about the whole business.
She felt certain her father had evaded telling
her all he might have. Was the new nurse involved
in some mystery?</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly Kitty recalled Bradâs worried expression
at the meeting of the two. He looked like one
who suspected the cause of the disharmony.
Though she could not question Nurse Dawson
there was no reason why she shouldnât talk to
Brad about what had happened. Maybe she would
see him at the USO party Saturday night.</p>

<p class='c011'>As she dressed for the party the following night,
Kittyâs thoughts were busy with what she would say
to Brad. All the girls were wearing gay evening
clothes, even though they were pre-war gowns, for
this made the occasion seem festive for the boys.</p>

<p class='c011'>Vera Parsons, a member of the Motor Corps,
who drove the station wagon around to collect
the girls for the USO parties, honked before Kitty
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>had quite finished dressing. She threw her coat
around her shoulders, caught up the skirt of the
fluffy evening dress of pale yellow, and hurried
toward the front door.</p>

<p class='c011'>She felt buoyantly happy as she kissed Billy
good night and joined the girls. Life had become
an interesting adventure once more, with a goal
to work toward. She had the happy feeling of one
who had at last found a niche into which she fitted
perfectly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty had been to only one other USO dance, for
she had been in no mood for parties when she first
joined her father on the island. She missed her
Aunt Nina too keenly. It was Vera Parsons who
made her realize these dances were not like most
others. She would not be going merely for her own
pleasure, but to help the boys forget they were
homesick and lonely and still had a big job ahead
of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou know they wonât allow just any sort of girl
to go to these dances,â Vera told her. âOnly those
of the highest caliber. Theyâre not always easy to
find, especially on an island as small as Palmetto.
We need all the nice girls we can get to help us
out.â</p>

<p class='c011'>So Kitty had attended the dance last Tuesday,
and enjoyed it immensely. It was then she had
noticed, though only casually, the Snack Bar which
the Canteen operated. Tonight she planned to give
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>the bar more than a brief inspection, and to get
acquainted with the workers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Vera knew all the girls and introduced Kitty.
She had been on the island a year and was acquainted
with everyone who was helping with war
work. Vera was a most capable girl, large and
rather muscular, but with such a wholesome attitude
Kitty warmed to her at once. She had come
upon her the first time on a sandy road running
through a palmetto thicket. Vera was changing a
tire with as much ease as a garage mechanic. Kitty
later learned that she was the type of girl who
doesnât hesitate to put her hands to any task. Her
reddish brown hair, snapping brown eyes and gusty
manner won her friends wherever she went.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWell, Kitty Carterâs soon going to be one of
you!â was her method of introducing the Canteen
candidate to the girls behind the Snack Bar. âKitty,
this is Mrs. Evans. Sheâs Chairman of the Corps
over here, and this is Sally Bright and Judy Conner.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWeâll surely be glad to have you,â spoke up
Mrs. Evans, a thin, sprightly woman in her fifties.
Though much older than the other two, she was
still young enough in spirit to be comradely.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI can hardly wait to begin my training,â said
Kitty, perching on one of the stools, and leaning
her elbows on the counter.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhen do you start?â asked Sally.</p>

<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c000' />

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>âMonday. The nutrition class first.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes, that must come first,â Mrs. Evans told her.
âItâs a prerequisite to the Canteen course. We
have to know a lot about food since our job is
feeding people under all sorts of circumstances.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd we have to know how to wash a stack of
dishes as high as the Washington Monument,â put
in Judy Conner with a groan.</p>

<p class='c011'>âFortunately no one has to do that all the time,â
Mrs. Evans explained. âWe take turns doing the
different tasks so everyone has an opportunity to
gain all-round experience.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm always glad when it comes my turn to make
out menus,â said Judy. âBut Sally actually likes to
clean up. Can you imagine that?â</p>

<p class='c011'>Sallyâs button nose wrinkled as her round face
spread into a grin. âStrange, but true. I like to
bring order out of chaos.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIsnât it wonderful that we have a group where
different ones like to do different things?â said Mrs.
Evans happily.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI like to cook,â Kitty told them. âI like experimenting
and creating new concoctions and trying
out new recipes.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm afraid there wonât be much opportunity for
new dishes in this work, but youâll be given plenty
of opportunity to cook if you like that.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty glanced at Sally with a look of appreciation.
âBut I just canât imagine anyone really liking to
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>clean a kitchen.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âTheyâre rare birds,â giggled Judy.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIt gives my esthetic nature a keen satisfaction
to leave a kitchen spick-and-span after the hullabaloo
is over,â Sally explained.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSometimes she is too anxious to clean,â Judy
reported. âShe has a way of cleaning up bowls and
spoons before the cooks have finished with âem.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Sally went back to the kitchen to end their teasing,
and Kitty asked, âIs the nutrition course very
hard?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, no. Miss Pearson makes it very interesting.
You learn all about food needs in emergencies and
food values for all times,â explained Mrs. Evans.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI guess we could all learn a lot about that.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIndeed we could! Part of our work, too, is
giving instructions and demonstrations to people.
Good health and sane living are so dependent on
proper diet.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âMore so than most people will admit,â said
Judy. âYouâll learn about that in nutrition class.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWell, it seems Iâm in line to learn lots that will
help me even after the war is won,â Kitty answered,
and she felt her interest and anticipation
in the work increasing.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThe most exciting part of the work comes at
the time of an emergency,â explained Mrs. Evans.
âI helped once during a flood out in Mississippi.
That was when I first went into Canteen work.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>âWhen we read about such things in the papers
they seem so unreal and far away,â said Kitty, suddenly
feeling a great sense of responsibility in her
new undertaking. She realized now that a Canteen
worker must have the courage and endurance of a
true soldier if she was to fulfill her obligations.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was much more she wanted to ask Mrs.
Evans and the girls, but at that moment the band
began playing and Jimmy Barnes, a young storekeeper,
came to ask her to dance with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The second dance had just begun when someone
tapped her partner on the shoulder. Kitty looked
over the sailorâs shoulder to see the spotless white
of a Naval officerâs uniform. She was surprised to
recognize Lieutenant Cary.</p>

<p class='c011'>She could not suppress a startled exclamation,
âOh, you?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSorry to break in, but I had to apologize for
leaving yesterday at the dock without telling you
how much I appreciated the ride from town, but
I was late for an appointment.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, that was O.K. Dad had told me to phone
so weâd have a way of getting Miss Dawsonâs bags
up from the dock.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSo sheâs an old friend?â</p>

<p class='c011'>Though the young doctorâs words seemed harmless
enough Kitty was instantly on the defensive.
Guardedly she replied, âI never saw her till yesterday.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>âThough you met her at the train?â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty noticed how blond the Lieutenantâs eyebrows
were when he lifted them with a skeptical
expression. She made no reply to his last remark,
not knowing how best to speak.</p>

<p class='c011'>He seemed to take the hint that the subject
was closed, and after an interval said, âYou dance
beautifully.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThanks.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou look charming tonight,â he persisted.</p>

<p class='c011'>She flushed in spite of not wanting him to pay
her compliments. She was about to make a pert
retort when she reminded herself that he, too, was
in the service, even though she disliked him personally.
After all she had come here to try to make
these men who were serving her country a bit happier.
Suddenly she caught sight of Brad watching
her with a puzzled expression.</p>

<p class='c011'>To her relief the band crashed out the finale at
that moment, and Brad came to claim her for the
next dance.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSo glad you came,â Kitty said cordially.</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo gladder than I am.â He grinned as he
looked her over with a sauciness at which no one
could take offense. Then he whistled softly.</p>

<p class='c011'>âGosh, but you look like a dream walking!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut I came here to dance, not walk.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou didnât come here to dance with Lieutenant
Cary from now on if I have anything to do with it.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>âWhy he dances divinely.â Kitty found herself
defending the man she didnât like just to take
Brad down a peg or two.</p>

<p class='c011'>âMaybe he learned his dance steps where the
great Strauss waltzes were born.â Brad glanced
around before he added âVienna.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou mean?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe canât talk here,â he warned quietly.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI wanted to talk to you about something, too.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDid you?â he asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>He took her arm and started toward the rear
door. Some steps led down to a court with a fountain
in the center and natural palms around it.
There were dim lights, and a hostess to make
everyone welcome.</p>

<p class='c011'>Brad found a seat at the far end where the lights
were dimmed enough for them to catch a glimpse
of the stars. Kitty glanced around to be sure that
no one else was within hearing distance.</p>

<p class='c011'>âBrad, did you notice anything odd yesterday
when I introduced Nurse Dawson to Lieutenant
Cary?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âPlenty!â He spoke the word with significance.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThey seemed to have an innate animosity for
each other when obviously they had never met
before.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIf you ask me, Kitty, it was a blow to Lieutenant
Cary to discover Ensign Dawson on her
way to Bernard Hospital.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>âBut why?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWell, I hardly know how to tell you. It seems
so intangibleâsort of hunch.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIt must be a mighty big hunch, for I have the
same sort of feeling that somethingâs wrong somewhere.
Miss Dawson looked so sort of burdened.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âGuess she has enough to make her feel depressed
and definitely self-conscious at being sent
to this hospital of all places.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSomething happened while her brother was
here. He left under a sort of shadow. Was shipped
off to Santiago.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou mean he almost got a bob-tail?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWell, not quite. But I heard things were terribly
mixed up in his work. He was Chief Pharmacistâs
Mate like your dad.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI wonder what was wrong?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs what I havenât been able to find out.
But on several occasions I heard him and Lieutenant
Cary having rather hot arguments. I could
never get to the root of their trouble.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThen you think Lieutenant Cary had something
to do with Dawsonâs leaving the hospital?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm convinced of it.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDid you know him very well?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI wasnât there long before he left, but I liked
him an awful lot.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNaturally Lieutenant Cary would resent Nurse
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>Dawson being sent to the same base.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd he didnât make any bones about showing
it,â said Brad in disgust.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty watched some couples go back to the dance
hall as the band struck up again. After an interval
she said, âBrad, I believe Dad knows something
about all this.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe ought to, if anyone does. They put him in
the position Dawson had filled.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe shut up like a clam when I told him what
happened in the launch yesterday.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty sat turning the opal ring on her third
finger, as she puzzled over the complications.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou have nice handsâcapable,â Brad told her.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs from all the years of piano practice. You
have to have piano, you know, along with voice
training.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSome time will you sing for me?â</p>

<p class='c011'>She smiled up into his eager eyes. âIâd love to.
But right now, Brad, I canât think of anything but
this queer business weâve stumbled on. I have a
queer feeling it may mean real trouble at the
hospital.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, I donât think itâs anything as serious as
that. But Iâll tell you frankly I donât trust Lieutenant
Cary. Heâs a man whoâll bear watching,
all right. I heard that just a year before the war
broke out he was studying surgery in Vienna and
Berlin.â</p>

<p class='c010'>Kitty was glad the sun was shining brightly Monday
morning when she ran to the window to look
out. She felt eager and ready to tackle the toughest
sort of job. She could face her friends with new
assurance now, for she was soon to be a part of the
great army of workers dedicated to restoring peace
to a troubled world.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a while at least, while their gasoline allowance
lasted, she was going back and forth in the
launch, as that would save at least an hour each day
in transportation time. Two other girls from the
island were going to take the course with her and
share those rides, so she felt justified in the use of
gasoline. She had spent the early years of her life
on the Gulf coast and was perfectly at home on the
water. And how she loved it!</p>

<p class='c011'>Vera Parsons had decided to add the Canteen
course to her other lines of service, and Sally
Brightâs sister, Lana, was joining also.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI hope the course wonât be too dry,â mused
Lana, when they were crossing the bay that first
morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIt wonât be if Miss Pearsonâs in charge,â Vera
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>assured her. âShe could put pep into a snail.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI wish I could begin work right now,â said
Kitty. âI donât see how Iâll have patience to wait
to finish the courses.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThereâs nothing to keep you from helping right
now,â Vera told her. âThereâre lots of Canteen
Aides.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âCanteen Aides?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âGirls who havenât taken the courses but do volunteer
work in emergencies.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, thatâs great! I want to get into it as soon
as possible. Iâve felt like a shirker these last
weeks.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI donât see why you call yourself a shirker,â
consoled Lana. âWith a kid brother, a dad and a
cottage to look after, I should think youâd have
your hands full.â</p>

<p class='c011'>The nutrition classes were being held in the
Power Companyâs demonstration kitchen. The trio
from Palmetto Island found about thirty women
and girls gathered when they arrived. Miss Pearson,
spotless in her attractive uniform, was already
giving out mimeographed sheets for study. All the
seats toward the back were taken, but Kitty and
her friends found folding chairs near the demonstration
table, where Miss Pearson had her materials
spread out.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty thought how easy it was to slip into the
old habit of making notes at lectures when she
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>took a notebook and fountain pen from her purse.
Miss Pearson had not been lecturing half an hour
when Kitty realized how valuable the classes were
going to be. She could use the information now
and long after the war.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI want to sketch briefly what we must cover in
this course,â Miss Pearson began. âAs a foundation
every one must know the requirements of good
nutrition, and the value of different kinds of food.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty thought how little attention she had paid
to such matters in the years she had been concentrating
on her music. She had eaten what was put
before her at school, and had given no heed to it
unless she became ill and the doctor restricted
her diet.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Miss Pearson mentioned that she would
give assistance in planning menus to fit food rationing
situations Kitty was really delighted. That
planning had been a mathematical problem to her
ever since she had started housekeeping.</p>

<p class='c011'>Field trips to large kitchens of the community,
and to food preserving plants promised interesting
diversions to classroom activities.</p>

<p class='c011'>âTomorrow morning Iâve arranged for us to
visit the Bayshore Bakery after class,â Miss Pearson
told them. âThere youâll learn a little about
mass production. You see we have to be prepared
to cook large quantities of food in times of emergency.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>Kitty saw that there was going to be real work,
also, in the course. At the bottom of their instruction
sheets were some questions that must be answered
next day in class.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe can discuss these going and coming in the
boat,â Kitty suggested to her friends as they were
going out.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI really think itâs going to be fun,â Lana said.</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd very valuable, too,â said Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI noticed a couple of women from over at the
oyster cannery settlement,â said Vera. âEvery woman
over there ought to be taking this course for
the good of her family. Miss Pearson is going to
show us how to make a little bit go a long way.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs surely something we can all use,â said
Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their excursion to the bakery was followed by a
visit to the oyster cannery, the community cannery,
a near-by cafeteria kitchen, and to a school lunchroom,
which was most efficiently organized.</p>

<p class='c011'>âEvery person in that lunchroom took our nutrition
course when I first gave it,â explained Miss
Pearson.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty found it hard to believe at the end of the
first week that half her nutrition course was already
complete. She had enjoyed every minute
of it. To be a part of a great scheme like this, in
which everyone was cooperating for the general
welfare gave her a glow of satisfaction. She didnât
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>mind at all that she had to work till bedtime to
finish her home duties, to see about Billyâs clothes,
and plan her own food program for the next day.
In her carefree days at college she had not dreamed
there was so much to be done in the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>Classes were held in the evening during the
second week of the course. This was a compromise
to fit the needs of several housewives, who found it
difficult to leave home in the morning. This arrangement
made it necessary for Kitty, Vera and
Lana to ride the island busses, as the girls could
not go alone in the launch at night.</p>

<p class='c011'>Palmetto Island was connected with the mainland
by a long causeway across the marshes. This
made the bus trip about three times the length of
the boat ride.</p>

<p class='c011'>The second evening, as the girls were returning
home about ten-thirty the bus stopped near the
oyster cannery to pick up some passengers. One of
them was a sailor, wearing the crescent of the
galley service. He impressed Kitty as being a raw
recruit. Though Kitty was preoccupied with her
own thoughts about the Canteen work, she had the
fleeting idea that the boy must be on his way back
to Bernard Hospital. She probably would never
have thought of him again had not something rather
peculiar happened.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sailor stood just in line of her vision on the
crowded bus. The man next to him had been smoking
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>a cigar when he came aboard, and now held it
in his hand. Suddenly as the bus lurched around a
corner red-hot ashes from the end of the cigar fell
on the sailorâs shoe. Instantly a spurt of flame ran
diagonally across the boyâs shoe, as if some inflammable
liquid had been spilled on it. Hastily the
sailor stamped out the flame with his other foot. It
all happened and was over in a flash. Kitty was
impressed enough by the incident, however, to
notice that the young man got off the bus at the
hospital station.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even then she would probably have forgotten
the incident but for the strange events of the following
day. She was roused at dawn by the telephone.
It was Mrs. Evans, Chairman of the island
Canteen unit.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThere was a big fire over at the oyster cannery
last night,â she told Kitty. âPractically every shack
on the point was burned down.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, how terrible! Can I do anything?â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty knew that the oyster cannery district was
the poorest housed section of town.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIndeed there is! We need every Canteen worker
we can get to help prepare for these homeless
people.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll be right down,â said Kitty promptly.</p>

<p class='c011'>âCould we use your launch?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh yes. Iâm sure Dad wonât object.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>âWe are already loading the station wagon, but
that wonât hold all we need. Miss Pearson phoned
from Bayport for us to bring dishes, equipment
and all the help we can get.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll be down as soon as I can put on my
clothes,â Kitty promised.</p>

<p class='c011'>How thankful she was that they had arranged
for Jane to have the small room behind the kitchen.
Kitty roused her and gave careful instructions
about the house and Billy, in case she would have
to be gone all day. Then she told her father about
the call, and in ten minutes was on her way down
to the Canteen.</p>

<p class='c011'>She helped Vera finish loading the station wagon
and they drove over to the dock where her boat
was housed. With the aid of Sally and Lana they
filled the boat with pots, pans, all sorts of utensils
and dishes, and what canned goods they had in
stock. So many willing hands made quick work
of the packing. They left only room enough for
Mrs. Evans, the two Bright girls and Kitty. Judy
Conner was going to help Vera pack the rest of
their things in the station wagon and drive around
over the causeway.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not until they were seated in the boat and on
their way to Bayport did Kitty find time to ask
about the fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThe old cannery was a regular firetrap anyhow,â
said Sally.</p>

<p class='c011'>âItâs a miracle the fire didnât sweep on to the
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>shipyards,â Mrs. Evans remarked. âThere was a
strong northeast wind blowing that carried burning
brands right in that direction.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSounds like sabotage,â put in Lana.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI doubt it,â said Mrs. Evans, who had a way of
thinking the best of everything and everybody. âA
careless match or hot cigarette ashes could have
started the fire in any of those dumps.â</p>

<p class='c011'>The mention of cigarette ashes made Kitty think
of the cigar ash falling on the sailorâs shoe in
the bus. Then with a feeling of shock she recalled
that the sailor had come aboard the bus in the
oyster cannery district. Could there possibly be
any connection between the two fires? She knew
that gasoline or kerosene was often used by saboteurs
in setting fires. Perhaps the main motive had
not been the destruction of the cannery and shacks,
but the shipyards and government docks beyond.</p>

<p class='c011'>Resolutely she tried to dismiss the entire affair,
thinking how unjust it was to be suspicious of
people she didnât know. At least she would say
nothing about it to anyone else, but she decided
to do some investigating on her own if opportunity
came.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was so much to be done on reaching the
scene of the disaster, however, that for a time Kitty
forgot all about the incident on the bus. The Bayport
Canteen workers had already set up a kitchen
in a small playground near the center of the oyster
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>cannery district.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was amazed at the devastation that had been
wrought in a few short hours. Practically every
home that had surrounded the oyster cannery and
docks had been burned to charcoal. The firemen,
seeing it was impossible to save the poorly built
shacks in the strong gale, had concentrated on preventing
the spread of the fire to the essential war
industries near by.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIt may be the best thing that could have happened
to these people,â said Miss Pearson, when
the island group of workers arrived. âWeâll see
that proper housing units surround the cannery
if it is rebuilt.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty had her initiation that day in the wonderful
work which the Red Cross does in emergencies.
As there was no adequate kitchen within easy
reach of the homeless people, cooking racks had
been set up in the open.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIf this were night and there was danger of air
raids,â Miss Pearson explained to a group of Canteen
apprentices who stood around the cook fire,
âweâd have to cover our cook fire completely to
keep it from being seen overhead.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âMy brother in the Coast Guard says even a
match struck in the marshes can be seen by a passing
plane,â Sally told them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon pots were steaming with coffee, while huge
saucepans held bubbling cereal. Kitty, with three
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>other girls, improvised a table and benches where
the children could sit to eat. In her group was
Mrs. Janice, a member of the nutrition class, whom
Vera had pointed out as a resident of the cannery
district. She was an uneducated woman with an
eager willingness to do everything in her power to
help. Three of her sons were in the service.
Though she and her other two children were now
left homeless, she was doing her bit to help her
fellow sufferers.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThereâs talk that the cannery was set afire,â she
told Kitty when they went off together to tear some
loose planks from a small section of the cannery
that had not burned.</p>

<p class='c011'>âReally! What have you heard about it?â Kitty
said, encouraging Mrs. Janice to talk.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThe night watchman said he saw a stranger
in dark clothes hurrying past the factory not ten
minutes before he discovered the fire.â Then she
added in a lower tone, âA sailor, too, he claims.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Could it be possible that the boy she had seen on
the bus had done this awful thing? But Kitty tried
not to show her suspicions as she said, âBut people
must constantly pass by the cannery.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs so, of course, but you know how it is.
You hear all sorts oâ talk. People round here were
mighty careful âbout fire, knowing how shoddy our
houses were.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âMaybe itâs a blessing in disguise. Youâll certainly
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>have better homes to live in after this.â</p>

<p class='c011'>With the aid of Mrs. Janiceâs fourteen-year-old
son, Jerry, they found a half dozen boards from
which they managed to make a table. The Canteen
workers were soon helping the hungry children to
bowls of hot cereal and milk as they lined up at
the table. Some of them were upset at being separated
from their parents, but Kitty had a way of
stilling their fears as she satisfied their hunger.</p>

<p class='c011'>When their breakfast was over, Kitty gave each
of them an apple and herded them over near the
swings. She solicited the aid of some older boys
and girls to keep the younger children amused
while their parents ate. Then for two hours she
helped wash the mountain-like pile of dishes.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHow long will we have to feed them?â she asked
Mrs. Evans, when she was finally drying her hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>âTired already?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, noâthat is, of course Iâm tired, but I didnât
mean it that way. I was just wondering whatâs to
be done about all these people. Where will they
sleep tonight? What will they do till more homes
can be built?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd well you may, my dear,â said Mrs. Evans
kindly. âThe town is packed to capacity with war
workers. In spite of that many homes have already
made room for some of these people. The
Red Cross will provide tents for others until permanent
shelter can be found. In the meantime
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>they are dependent on the Canteen Corps for
food.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kittyâs eyes were starry as she looked at her leader.
âItâs wonderful work, isnât it, Mrs. Evans?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIndeed it is!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIf this fire was the work of saboteurs, it only
makes us dedicate ourselves all the more devotedly
to bringing peace and harmony in the end.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSometimes the most loyal person can let carelessness
make him the worst sort of saboteur,â said
Mrs. Evans significantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty thought she had more reason than anyone
else for doubting that that fire had been started
by a careless patriot. She had thought at first that
she would keep quiet about the little incident on
the bus last night, but now she made up her mind
to take Brad Mason into her confidence. Brad
might be in a position to make some investigations
that she could not about the sailor.</p>

  <h2 id='bar' class='c002'><span class='large'>CHAPTER FIVE</span><br />Â <br /><span class='large'>THE SNACK BAR</span></h2>

<p class='c010'>Nutrition classes were suspended for the duration
of the emergency.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâll learn more through actual experience
now,â Miss Pearson told them, âthan I could teach
you in many lessons.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty spent as much time as possible during the
next three days helping to feed the homeless cannery
workers and their families. Tuesday evening
she was much too weary to go to the regular USO
party, and so she had no opportunity to see Brad
till the following Saturday.</p>

<p class='c011'>By that time her excitement over the fire had
cooled, and she was afraid he would think her silly
to accuse the strange sailor of having anything to
do with it. A score of times she had heard her
father say, âWhen in doubt say nothing.â So she
wisely followed his advice.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was so much work to be done in the closing
days of the nutrition class that she had no time
to think of anything else. The course had opened
up to her a whole new world of practical interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI canât believe weâve learned so much in two
weeks,â she said to Lana and Vera.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>âIâm surely glad Miss Pearson taught us every
day, instead of once a week as they do in some
places,â said Vera.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll say,â agreed Lana. âItâs much better to do
it in two weeks instead of ten.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd itâs been so much fun, too,â said Kitty.
âOnly think of the places weâve visitedâpacking
plants, canneries, bakeries, restaurant kitchens. Itâs
so interesting to learn about all the food industries
around this part of the country.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâve got a whole notebook full of recipes, and
ideas about food I can put to good use when my
Jim comes back from Italy,â said Vera.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHuh,â laughed Kitty, âI donât have to wait for
anybody to come back.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Lana laughed too. âThatâs right. You have a dad
and little brother to experiment on right now.â</p>

<p class='c011'>On the last evening, as they were going over to
class, Kitty said to her two pals, âStrange, but I
donât feel a bit nervous over the exam.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âItâs been so practical and interesting thereâs no
sense in anyone being nervous,â Vera agreed.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI wish I felt as certain as you two,â said Lana,
who was still poring over her tables of vitamins
and caloric values.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this final meeting all except three members
of the class signed up to go on with the Canteen
work, though Kitty and her two friends were the
only ones from Palmetto Island. Kitty felt a real
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>glow of pride when she received her certificate at
the conclusion of the course. Each member of the
class was also given a recipe book to help with her
own home menus.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Canteen course that followed immediately
under Mrs. Evans gave quite a different kind of
instruction. The brief experience they had already
had in emergency feeding made them keenly appreciative
of all the phases of the Canteen instruction.
Step by step they discussed all the angles of the
work; planning menus for large scale feeding, food
preparation, and here the course they had just
taken was of invaluable aid. They also discussed
methods of food service and how to keep a Canteen
orderly and spotless. Kitty was one of the group
who received some practical experience in serving
food at the blood donation center twice a week.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two days before this course ended there was a
railroad wreck twenty-five miles from town. Kitty
went with the mobile canteen to supply food for
the rescue crew who were working to clear the
wounded from the wreck. It happened to be Hazel
Dawsonâs day off, and she, too, went in the Red
Cross station wagon, and worked like a trooper,
giving first aid to the wounded.</p>

<p class='c011'>âTired?â asked Hazel gently as they were riding
home in the Red Cross car at ten oâclock that night.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI didnât know I was tired till I sat down,â
Kitty admitted. âBut Hazel, isnât it wonderful to
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>be able to help people at a time like this?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThereâs nothing in life quite so wonderful. You
have the spirit of a real Canteen worker, Kitty.
Itâs a privilege to feed menâs bodies when theyâre
hungry, but itâs still more wonderful to give comfort
to their souls and anxious minds as I saw you
doing several times today.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty had had no greater sense of pride when she
donned her cap and gown at graduation than she
felt the day she was entitled to wear her Canteen
uniform the first time. She was going over to Bayport
to meet a troop train with several of the
workers.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Belgian blue poplin dress made her bright
eyes seem all the bluer. Her heart was beating
proudly when she arranged her cap behind the auburn
hair rolled softly into a pompadour. She had
a feeling of real pride in those red crosses on her
pocket and the white band of her cap. Some day
she meant to earn service bars, too. Mrs. Evans
wore a chevron and three bars, representing seven
years of service.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although the girls did not wear their uniforms
at the Snack Bar, Kitty donned the official apron
she was allowed to wear there on the first evening
after finishing her course. Though she had done
much volunteer work at the bar she felt somewhat
elated tonight over being a full-fledged Canteen
worker.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>She was in an expansive mood and said as she
and Judy were slicing bread for sandwiches, âLetâs
make âem extra large, with plenty of stuffing just
to celebrate our graduation.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou might make that special dressing you were
telling me about,â Judy suggested.</p>

<p class='c011'>âMay I, Mrs. Evans?â Kitty asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOf course. The boys always enjoy something
different.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty had learned to make a tart creole sauce for
sandwich filling from their cook in New Orleans,
so she prepared a bowlful. By the time the boys
began to drift into the hall the air was fragrant
with coffee and chocolate, and trays of sandwiches
were ready.</p>

<p class='c011'>Brad, knowing it was Kittyâs initiation night,
was one of the first bluejackets to plant his elbows
on the counter and demand a sandwich.</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd a cupa cawfee, too, wench, and be snappy
about it!â he said with mock gruffness.</p>

<p class='c011'>She made a face at him as she turned to get the
coffee.</p>

<p class='c011'>After one bite of the sandwich Bradâs eyes
bulged. âOh boy! This tastes like something from
Toniâs swanky joint in New Orleans.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty laughed in delight. âOur old cook used
to work at Toniâs. She gave me lots of his secrets.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Jimmy Barnes sat beside Brad taking huge bites
of a sandwich. He enthusiastically added his praise
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>to Bradâs. âBoy, but this is really seasoned up like
home cooking.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAbout the best seasoning they give us up at
the hospital is the shrimp creole.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd they only have that about twice a month,â
added Jimmy in disgust.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kittyâs curiosity stirred. Maybe this was her
chance to learn something about the staff in the
galley.</p>

<p class='c011'>âDo you know the cooks very well?â she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOnly a passing acquaintance,â said Brad. âOur
Chief Commissary Steward is named Kromeâan
old timer at the job.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI saw a thin, dark-looking chap on the bus the
other night with a crescent on his arm. Do you
happen to know him?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âQuite a number down there,â said Jimmy dubiously.
âOnly one Iâve talked to very often is a
fair young chap, named Ned Miller.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThereâs one named Punaro fits your description,â
Brad told Kitty. âHe empties wastebaskets
on our floor.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âRight youngâabout eighteen or nineteen?â
Kitty persisted.</p>

<p class='c011'>âAbout that. Only been in a few months. Why?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, nothing. I just happened to see him the
other day on the bus.â</p>

<p class='c011'>A few minutes later Brad and Jimmy went off to
play a game of pingpong with some of the girls
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>and for the next hour Kitty was very busy at the
bar. Later during a lull in their business she
glanced down the hall and noticed that Lieutenant
Cary was playing chess with someone in the south
corner of the room. They were about the only two
who had not patronized the Snack Bar during the
evening.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhatâs so interesting over there?â Bradâs teasing
tone jolted Kitty out of her curious speculation.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhoâs that playing chess with Lieutenant
Cary?â she asked in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>Brad glanced to the south corner of the room
and replied, âKrome.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou mean the head cook up at the hospital?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhatâs so surprising about that?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSomehow I thought Lieutenant Cary would be
too snippity to play chess with the cook.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy Kromeâs Chief Commissary Steward. Lieutenant
Cary has no reason to be high-hat to him.
He was in the service long before Cary ever
thought of such a thing.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIs that so?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSure.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut Dr. Cary is a lieutenant.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âJust the same heâs only been in the service a
few months. Heâs one of the physicians recently
recruited.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, I see,â murmured Kitty in a significant
tone. Then she asked, âDo you know anything
about the cook?â</p>

<p><i>âWhatâs So Interesting There?â Brad Asked</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c000' />

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>Brad laughed. âI know he can dish up some
mighty good chow on occasion.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe looks as though he didnât object to good
eating himself. He must weigh two hundred and
twenty-five at least.â Kitty tried to make her tone
seem trivial in case anyone else had overheard
their conversation.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll be trotting along,â Brad said. âI promised
to make a fourth for bridge over yonder.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty held his eyes a moment and lowered her
voice to say, âThereâs something I want to talk
to you about when I have a chance.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll see you home if you can get through before
eleven. We can talk on the way up.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âFine,â she agreed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Brad had scarcely taken his seat with the other
players when Lieutenant Cary and Chief Krome
came toward the bar.</p>

<p class='c011'>Excitedly Kitty whispered to Judy, âLet me wait
on them if they come here.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Judy sent her a surprised look. âYouâre welcome
to them. I wouldnât be interested.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNeither am I, in the way you think,â retorted
Kitty with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>She thought what an odd pair they made as they
came toward the Snack Bar. Lieutenant Cary was
as lean and alert as a bloodhound, while the square-rigged
Krome was almost a head shorter. Kitty
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>would have felt curious about any man who was
friendly with Lieutenant Cary, even if her curiosity
had not already been stirred by one of
Kromeâs assistants, so that the association brought
the Chief Steward under suspicion also.</p>

<p class='c011'>Vera came out of the kitchen just as the two men
straddled the stools at the counter and she took
Lieutenant Caryâs order. Kittyâs hand was a little
unsteady as she poured Kromeâs cup of coffee.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe have some special sandwiches tonight,â Judy
explained to the two customers, âmade by our new
Canteen worker, Miss Kitty Carter.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll take two,â Krome spoke up promptly.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Kitty faced the head cook squarely he
seemed such a hearty, good-natured sort her suspicions
evaporated like the steam above his coffee
cup.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSo youâre now a full-fledged Canteen worker.â
Though Lieutenant Caryâs smile and words were
friendly enough his tone held a slight cynicism.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI wasnât a bit prouder when I donned my cap
and gown at graduation from college, than when I
put on my uniform the first time,â she said frankly.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThey got something when they got you, young
lady,â spoke up Krome warmly. âThese sandwiches
ainât to be sneezed at.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy, Iâm thrilled that you think so! They tell
me you can serve some very good things over at
the hospital, and I can vouch for it myself the few
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>times Iâve eaten there.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSo youâre Chief Carterâs daughter?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd proud I am to have the honor.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Krome finished the last crumb of his sandwich,
and said, âHow about giving me the recipe for that
sandwich filling?â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty looked disconcerted. âIf you feed the boys
on it at the hospital they may not want our sandwiches
down here.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll promise not to do that.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty laughed. âOh, really, I wouldnât be that
selfish. Youâre welcome to the recipe. And maybe
youâd do me a favor in return.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Krome looked surprised. âMe do you a favor?â
he asked, indicating himself, then Kitty with his fat
hand. Then he laughed as if it were a great joke.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI heard the boys talking about your grand
shrimp creoleâand that they donât get it often
enough. How about giving me that recipe?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, that? Sure. Weâll swap recipes then. Iâll
bring it next time I come.â</p>

<p class='c011'>When the men had gone Judy said with a sniff,
âIf you ever get a recipe out of him youâll do better
than Mrs. Evans has. Heâs promised her several
and never brought them.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âMaybe heâll pay more attention to my request
if he wants a recipe from me.â</p>

<p class='c011'>At ten-thirty when Kitty put on her light wrap
to go home she was really tired. But how glowingly
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>happy she felt at the realization that her job
had been well done! Brad was waiting for her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Though it was only March there was more than
a hint of spring in the balmy night air, and the
stars seemed close and warm in a sky like deep
purple porcelain. Neither of them spoke while
they walked the first block.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Brad said, âYou wanted to ask me about
something?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes, I did. But somehow it seems absurd to be
suspicious of anyone on a night like this.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWell, forget it.â After an interval he asked,
âThink youâre going to enjoy the Canteen work?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm crazy about it. But really it seems so little
to do when thereâs so much to be done.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âItâs all the little bits put together thatâs going
to help us win this war.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd prepare us to live in a more wonderful
peace afterward. Itâs learning to work together
thatâs so important.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOne person pulling in the wrong direction can
upset the whole works.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty made no reply, but she thought he must
know what was on her mind even before he added,
âI figure youâve been wondering why Krome and
Cary seem so intimate.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou hit the nail on the head!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWeâve both put a big question mark behind
Cary, and when we see Krome buddying with him
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>he gets a question mark, too.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNot only Krome.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThat chap, Punaro, you were asking about?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âUh-huh.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhatâs he done?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâve hesitated a long time about mentioning it.
It may seem Iâm straining at a gnat.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âLetâs have it,â he urged.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou do hate to suspect people of being spies
and saboteurs, especially when theyâre right in the
hospital with your own father.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAll the more reason you shouldnât take any
chances.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Quickly Kitty gave Brad an account of the little
incident on the bus three weeks earlier. âIt seems
sort of absurd now that Iâm talking about it for the
first time to think the boy might have had anything
to do with the fire at the oyster cannery, but thatâs
exactly what I have been thinking.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI donât think your suspicions are unfounded.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIf he used gasoline or kerosene to start that fire
it was still fresh enough to flame up from those
cigar ashes. And he certainly did get on the bus
right at the cannery station.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIf that fire was the work of saboteurs the objective
was no doubt the shipyards, not the cannery.â</p>

<p class='c011'>They walked on to Kittyâs door in silence. Then
Brad said, âI sure wish youâd told me about this
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>when it happened.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy? I canât see that we can do anything.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âMaybe I could have managed to get a squint
at Punaroâs shoes.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âPunaroâs shoes? But the gasoline, or whatever
it was, had already burned off.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut shell dust would still have been on the
soles next morning.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSayâthatâs so! I hadnât thought of that.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou know all that land around the cannery has
been built up of oyster shells,â explained Brad. âIt
was once only a marshy bog they tell me. If
Punaro set that fire heâd be obliged to get shell
dust on his shoes.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThe only paved sidewalk runs along the street
where the bus stopped,â explained Kitty. âI noticed
that the day we went over to open the
Canteen.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThereâs a possibility I might still find out
something.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHow?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe probably stopped wearing those shoes with
the burned stain. If he discarded them right away
theyâd probably still bear the evidence of shell
dust.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd even if you found out heâd really been
there, Brad, where would it take us?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI donât know, but you can just be sure, Kit,
Iâm not going to let a thing like this slide by.â</p>

  <h2 id='revelation' class='c002'><span class='large'>CHAPTER SIX</span><br />Â <br /><span class='large'>A REVELATION</span></h2>

<p class='c010'>Kitty was still thinking of her conversation with
Brad when she went in to help Jane with breakfast
the next morning. What could they do about it,
even if they had positive proof that the Punaro
boy had visited the oyster cannery on the night of
the fire? He could claim he had gone there to see
friends, and they would have accomplished nothing
by their prying. She hoped Brad wouldnât get in
any trouble about it.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHow did you like your Canteen work?â her
father asked at breakfast.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, fine!â she exclaimed, her thoughts returning
to the real work of the previous evening. âItâs
really loads of fun. Iâm going to be on duty every
other night.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâll be doing more than your quota of hours,
wonât you?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, I donât mind that. This is no time to stick
to quotas, you know.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou spoke a truth then, Kitten,â her father said
proudly.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe have so few workers over here on the island
each of us will have to do double duty. Itâs going
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>to be loads of fun.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm so pleased youâve found your place in the
war program. I was sure you would.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty glanced at her father gratefully as she
handed him the hot muffins Jane had brought in.</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo, thanks. I have plenty.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut, Dad, you always eat two. And you havenât
eaten half your eggs. Thatâs very unpatriotic with
eggs so high.â</p>

<p class='c011'>He laughed. âIâm beginning to see the effects of
your nutrition course already.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll admit itâs made me food conscious, and I
was already point conscious.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI must hand it to you women for having a
streak of genius with handling rationing points.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm ashamed to admit it, Dad, but I find myself
figuring up point values first and almost forgetting
what a thing is going to cost.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâve had a few worries myself over supplies,â
he said, and Kitty saw the furrow deepen between
his brows.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHowâs that, Dad?â she asked eagerly, hoping he
would open up about what was on his mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, you have problems enough without being
burdened with mine,â he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty ate the last half of her muffin with some
orange-blossom honey, then she sat looking thoughtfully
at her father. She had been so absorbed in
her own activities lately she had paid scant heed to
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>his failing appetite. Now she realized he had eaten
very little for several days.</p>

<p class='c011'>âDad, donât you think youâd better take a tonic
or something?â she said finally. âYour appetite is
just about gone.â</p>

<p class='c011'>He tried to laugh off her anxiety. âOh, Iâll pick
up in a day or so. Iâve been rather preoccupied
with things at the office.â</p>

<p class='c011'>His admission gave her a start. âAnything
wrong?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNothing that canât be adjusted in time, I hope.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou couldnât tell me about it?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo sense in burdening you with my problems.
Kitty. You have enough on your shoulders now.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âMaybe I could help. Sometimes problems clear
up after talking them over with others. Every time
Iâve ever brought my troubles to you they seem to
vanish in thin air.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThereâre some things a man canât talk over with
anyone, Kitten, when heâs in the service. He has
to keep things from even his own daughter, whom
heâd trust with his very life.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty was now certain that there was something
radically wrong. Was it possible that it could in
any way be connected with the clues she had
picked up in the last few weeks? Willard Dawson,
Chief Pharmacistâs Mate, who had just preceded
him, had been involved in some sort of trouble at
the hospital. Was her father becoming involved in
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>the same sort of complications? The idea that he,
also, might be relegated to some remote base, filled
Kitty with terror. The life they were living here
together seemed a paradise when she feared that
something tragic might happen to end it.</p>

<p class='c011'>After her father had gone to the hospital Kitty
couldnât put him from her mind. She decided she
must do something to lift him out of his depression.
Later when she was in the kitchen helping to
fix Billyâs breakfast plate, she remarked to Jane
that she was afraid her father wasnât very well.</p>

<p class='c011'>âReckon he worried âbout somepen, Miss Kit?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy? What makes you think that?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âLasâ night atter us all in bed I hear him pacinâ
back anâ foâth, back anâ foâth, like somepen whutâs
trapped.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSomepen whutâs trapped,â kept ringing in Kittyâs
head after she left the kitchen. This morning
she felt like someone who had picked up half a
dozen pieces of a jig-saw puzzle out of which she
could make no sense at all. If she had had any idea
of what was back of it all she might have pieced
them together in an orderly pattern.</p>

<p class='c011'>Later as she gathered fresh nasturtiums from the
little flower bed under the living-room window,
the vision of Lieutenant Cary and Chief Krome
playing chess rose up to trouble her. Surely they
could have nothing to do with her fatherâs anxieties.
Yet she could not forget the mutual antagonism
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>which Cary and Hazel had shown each other
instantly, and she felt instinctively that they were
all involved in a strange chess game which she had
to play blindfolded. But she was determined, if
her alertness could prevent it, that her father
would never become a pawn to be sacrificed as
Willard Dawson had been.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly she had a sense of guilt that she had
given her father so little companionship lately.
Then she thought of Nurse Dawson, and something
he had said when she first arrived, âWe must
have her over to dinner some evening. It means
so much to people in the service to go into real
homes.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy not have her over tonight?â she thought.
She had an evening free of Canteen work, and
Dad definitely needed cheering up. She hurried to
her desk drawer to study her ration books to see
if there were enough points left for a decent roast.
Since Dad had been eating two meals at home he
also had books, which helped out greatly, and with
Janeâs books added she had much more latitude in
her buying.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father had just reached his office when Kitty
got him on the phone. She made her tone as
sprightly as possible when she asked, âDad, how
about having Hazel over to dinner tonight?â</p>

<p class='c011'>His voice had an eager quality when he answered,
âOh, fine, Kitten! It wouldnât be too much
bother?â</p>

<p><i>âHow About Asking Hazel Over Tonight?â</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c000' />

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>âNo, indeed! Iâve been wanting to for a long
time. And this evening I havenât another thing to
do. Will you ask her?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âMaybe youâd better phone her. I wonât have
an opportunity to see her till lunch, and by that
time she may have made other plans.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âO.K., old dear, just as you say.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âTell her Iâll call for her at six.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty thought as she dialed the hospital that her
father had let slip an important point. In mentioning
that he wouldnât see Hazel till noon, he
implied that they must eat together every day.
The thought made her feel very happy.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Kitty finally got in touch with Hazel and
gave her the invitation she eagerly accepted.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIs she cominâ?â Jane wanted to know as she
stood in the doorway, awaiting the answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>âShe and Dad were as pleased as two kids being
invited to a picnic. Weâll have to give them a swell
feed, Jane, and see if this improves his appetite.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty dashed off to the market to see what she
could get for their dinner. She did a weekly shopping
in Bayport on Saturdays. In order to save
gasoline she tried to manage the rest of the time
with what she could pick up on the island.</p>

<p class='c011'>It proved to be a busy day for both her and
Jane. While the negro girl was busy in the kitchen,
Kitty tried to brighten up the rather shabby
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>furnishings of their little cottage. She reminded
herself that it was wartime and one must make the
best of undesirable living conditions. They had
brought their own silver and linens from their old
home on the Gulf coast, and with these she made
the table look very pretty. The bowl of nasturtiums
in the center gave quite a festive air.</p>

<p class='c011'>âAinât no use to worry âbout de looks, Miss Kit,â
Jane consoled her when she arranged and re-arranged
the flowers to get the right effect. âUs make
de grub taste good enough anâ dey wonât think
âbout nothinâ else. Dese ainât no times to worry
âbout de frills oâ livinâ.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty had often thought that Jane, with a little
more education, would have made a fine philosopher.
Certainly she would never die of worrying
over what couldnât be helped.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty wore sweater suits so constantly she felt
really dressed up when she put on one of her old
silk prints and let her hair down from its tight
ringlets to fall in soft auburn curls about her face.
It seemed to belong that way with the flowered
print.</p>

<p class='c011'>Though Kitty had intended cultivating Hazel
Dawsonâs acquaintance she had actually been with
her only once since her arrival. Then she and her
father and Hazel had eaten lunch together in the
hospital dining-room, where there was little chance
for connected conversation. So Kitty was also glad
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>of this opportunity to develop their friendship.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hazel couldnât praise Kittyâs delicious dinner
enough, and remarked several times how wonderful
it was to be in a real home.</p>

<p class='c011'>âItâs nothing like the lovely bungalow we had
in New Orleans,â said Kitty. âOf course we had
our own things there. But Iâm not complaining.
Itâs too wonderful that we can be together in any
sort of home now.â</p>

<p class='c011'>After a while Kitty slipped into the background
and listened while her father and Hazel discussed
other places they had worked, and mutual friends
who were now scattered far and wide. The meal
was not half over before Kitty was certain her
father had more than a passing interest in this
nurse. His preoccupation of the morning had vanished
with the genial companionship.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm hoping Iâll get a chance at overseas duty
again,â said Hazel.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou wouldnât want to go till you finish the job
you came here to do.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, no! No, indeed! I wouldnât be satisfied to
go anywhere till thatâs done.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty glanced speculatively from one to the other.
Their words implied much. When Hazel looked
across the table to find a puzzled expression on
Kittyâs face, she instantly changed the subject.</p>

<p class='c011'>âDonât forget, my dear, that you promised to
take me on a tour of these inland waterways.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>âI havenât forgotten, but there was so much to
be done while I was taking my Canteen course.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm so interested in this coast country. Itâs
really beautiful.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIn a week or so the weather will be getting
very mild, then weâll make a day of it when you
have some time off,â Kitty promised.</p>

<p class='c011'>After dinner Kitty excused herself to see about
Billy, who had eaten earlier and been put to bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>As she went down the hall she heard Hazel say
to her father, âIâve been wanting to tell you something
I have just uncovered.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Then for the first time Kitty felt certain that
Hazel Dawson had come to the Bernard Hospital
in the double capacity of nurse and investigator in
behalf of her brother. In order to give them plenty
of time for consultation she stayed in Billyâs room
an hour, reading him bedtime stories.</p>

<p class='c011'>His sleepy eyes had been closed some time when
her father poked his head in the doorway and
asked, âKitten, arenât you coming back to the
living-room?â</p>

<p class='c011'>She tried to smile disarmingly as she said softly,
âBilly felt sort of out of it all. I had to make it
up to him.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI want you to sing for Hazel,â he added as they
went down the hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, please do!â exclaimed Hazel, who overheard
them. âIâve always wanted to hear you sing.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>âThis old piano is terribly out of tune, and Iâm
out of practice, but Iâll try.â</p>

<p class='c011'>She sang a simple little lullaby first, and gaining
courage from their praise, she sang the aria
she had learned for her closing recital at school.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, Kitty darling, your voice is really beautiful,
so full and rich. You <i>must</i> go on with your
music! All the world ought to be hearing that
beautiful voice.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Hazelâs words once more stirred Kittyâs old ambition,
that had been overshadowed of late by circumstances.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhen the war is over, maybe,â she tried to
speak with an indifference she did not feel. âBut
right now I have other jobs to do.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHavenât we all!â said Hazel significantly, and
turned to meet her friendâs understanding glance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Later when her father had gone to take Hazel
home, Kitty sat at the window a long time. She
felt an unaccountable loneliness, even while her
heart rejoiced at what the evening had revealed.
What a wonderful wife Hazel would make for her
dad! His loneliness had long been a source of unhappiness
to her. Finally she went to her room,
humming softly the lullaby, hoping that those suspicions
at least had good foundation. Maybe some
day after the war she would have a home of her
own. What a comfort it would be to know Dad was
not left alone!</p>

  <h2 id='web' class='c002'><span class='large'>CHAPTER SEVEN</span><br />Â <br /><span class='large'>THE TANGLED WEB</span></h2>

<p class='c010'>A wild March gale was howling over the island
the following evening. Though rain poured in torrents
Kitty found a score of marines and sailors
already in the USO hall when she arrived at the
Snack Bar. On such nights she always thought of
the boys across the water, who were fighting in all
sorts of weather. The Snack Bar and the cozy
atmosphere of the big hall made her wish they
could all share this comfort.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nell Cruger, the USO hostess, was worried when
she remarked to Kitty, âVera just phoned from
out at Thompsonsâ place that sheâs stuck in the
mud but will get here as soon as she can. We
havenât half enough girls to keep the boys entertained
till then.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, depend on Vera to get out of any sort of
tight spot,â replied Kitty confidently. âSheâll be
along after a while with a station wagon full of
girls.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty had her own Canteen duties to look after
and was quite busy for half an hour before she
realized that Vera had not yet arrived. Only one
carful of girls had come in, and although they
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>were doing their best to make the boys have a
pleasant evening, there was still not nearly enough
girls. Kitty decided the Canteen girls would have
to do double duty by helping the USO hostess.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was about to tell Mrs. Evans she would go
outside into the hall to be some boyâs partner for
a dance when she noticed a lonesome-looking fellow
at her own Snack Bar. She had served him a
cup of coffee when he first came in and had made
overtures of friendship which had been indifferently
received. He still sat on the end stool, looking
dejectedly into space, half his coffee still in the cup.</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnything else youâd like?â she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo, thanks,â he replied, without changing his
position or looking toward her.</p>

<p class='c011'>She went back to the kitchen a moment later to
get some more cream, and Sally, elbow deep in
suds, said, âPoor boy, heâs been sitting there in a
fog for the last half hour. Guess heâs got something
rather bothersome on his mind.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe looks like a new one in the service,â commented
Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>Later as she wiped the counter clean she noticed
the sailorâs fresh, fair complexion not yet tanned
by the southern sun. There was something about
him that made her think of Billy. Her own little
brother might look like that when he was grown
up. In twenty years she hoped there wouldnât be
another war to catch him in its snares. If it had
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>to happen she knew she would thank any Canteen
worker who would cheer him.</p>

<p class='c011'>She pushed a neatly wrapped sandwich toward
the sailor. âThese sandwiches are really good,â she
said encouragingly. âWouldnât you like to try
one?â</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he turned slightly and looked at her for
the first time. âI couldnât swallow a bite,â he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>His gentle gray eyes were as pathetic as a frightened
lambâs. Kitty couldnât bear it. She darted
back to the kitchen to tell Mrs. Evans about him.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHeâs been sitting there utterly dejected for the
last half hour.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHeâs Ned Miller,â explained Sally. âIâve noticed
him several times latelyâseems awfully depressed.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe doesnât even know theyâre dancing and playing
games out there in the hall,â Kitty said.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll see if I can draw him out,â Mrs. Evans
volunteered.</p>

<p class='c011'>She strolled from the kitchen and pretended to
be busy at the counter. In a casual manner she
addressed Ned, âWouldnât you like to dance a bit?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo, thanks, I donât want to dance.â His tone
was flat from lack of interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>âTheyâre scarce of girls tonight, but weâre not so
busy either. I could spare one of the Canteen girls
to play a game of checkers with you, if you like.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo, thanks.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Just inside the kitchen door Kitty and Sally
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>listened to Mrs. Evansâs overtures of friendship.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finally she spoke in a motherly tone. âSon,
youâre worried about something. Isnât there anything
I can do for you?â</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the pleading gray eyes looked up at the
motherly face and this time they were swimming
in tears. For a moment he seemed to be appraising
her. Finding the sympathy of her heart reflected
in her eyes he finally blurted, âIâI want
to hold a baby.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty, watching beside Sally in the background
fairly held her breath at this unexpected retort.</p>

<p class='c011'>âA baby?â repeated Mrs. Evans.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ned dug into his pocket and brought out a yellow
sheet of paper. The girls saw it was a telegram
as he handed it to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOur baby came yesterday. Theyâreâtheyâre in
California. IâIâve been so scared for her the last
week I havenât had good sense. I canât believe itâs
all over and sheâs all right.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh thatâs wonderful!â exclaimed Mrs. Evans.
âAnd a boy, too. Eight pounds.â</p>

<p class='c011'>He grew more confidential at her warmth and
understanding.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIfâif I could only hold a baby once to see how
it feels. Iâve never held a baby. Maybe I can believe
Iâm a father when I know how a baby feels.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Hot tears blinded Kittyâs eyes, and her throat
tightened. How tragic it was to be three thousand
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>miles away from your firstborn, with no real hope
of ever seeing him before you were sent across!</p>

<p class='c011'>âSally, Iâm going to find a baby for him to hold
if thereâs a young baby on this island!â Kitty
whispered.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sally wiggled her button nose as she, too, blinked
back the tears. âSay, but thatâs tough! Whereâll
you find a young one, Kit? I donât know where
thereâs a young baby.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll find one. Youâll see,â said Kitty and dashed
out to the telephone.</p>

<p class='c011'>In two minutes she had Hazel Dawson on the
phone. Surely she would know if any of the wives
of the service men up at the hospital had young
babies.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hazel was rather surprised at Kittyâs unusual
request, but after a little thought said, âMrs. Harperâs
baby is about ten days old. She came back
from the hospital in town yesterday, I believe.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDo you think you could possibly arrange for
me to bring Ned Miller up to see it?â asked Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm sure theyâd be glad to have him visit
them,â Hazel said kindly. âSuppose you come past
the hospital tomorrow at four-thirty when I get off
duty and Iâll go with you.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, youâre an angel! If you could only see this
pathetic boy, youâd do anything in the world to
make him a little happier.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty tried not to seem too excited over her success
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>when she went back behind the bar. Mrs.
Evans was still talking to Ned when she joined
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThe Harpers have a young baby,â she said almost
bluntly.</p>

<p class='c011'>He glanced at her quickly, and his sensitive face
flushed. âMaybe you think itâs silly of me,â he
apologized. âBut itâs an awful feeling to be three
thousand miles away from your wife and baby.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâre not silly at all! Iâd be thrilled to pieces
to go to see the Harpersâ baby with you. Theyâre
friends of Hazel Dawson. You know Ensign Dawson
up at the hospital?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSure. Sheâs always ready to help somebody.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThe Harpersâ baby is a few days older than
yours, but then theyâd feel the same.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâre so kind to go to all that trouble for me.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll pick you up in our car tomorrow at four-thirty.
Iâm going over to get Miss Dawson anyhow.
She said sheâd go with us and make arrangements
with the Harpers.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI just canât thank you enough.â A smile actually
brightened Nedâs face as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>While Kitty was still talking to him Vera came
in with half a dozen girls. After she turned them
loose in the hall she went behind the Snack Bar
looking rather excited. Kitty suggested that one
of the new arrivals dance with Ned, and when they
had gone she said to Vera, âHear you had quite a
time.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>âIâll say.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWere you alone when you got stuck?â asked
Sally.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSure! You never get stuck when thereâs anyone
along to help.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhere were you?â asked Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOn that lonely stretch of road leading to the
Thompson place. I went out there to get Nancy.
Rain had made the sand all gooey this side of
Waco bridge, and I got stuck fast.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIn that dark, swampy road?â asked Sally.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIt would be there,â said Vera in disgust. âI
worked till nearly dark trying to get out, then I
started on foot toward Thompsonsâ. I was just
about to cross the bridge over Waco Creek when
I heard oars up the stream.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâd have been scared stiff there by myself,â said
Sally with a shiver.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI was too mad over being stuck to feel scared,â
Vera stated. âI yelled for that boatman to come and
help me outâtold him I was stuck.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWell?â said Kitty, sensing there was something
very peculiar to come. âHe did help you, of
course.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNot that sneak! The minute I yelled for help
those oars stopped and I never heard another
sound.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy, he couldnât help but know it was a
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>woman calling!â Kitty exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSure, he knew it was a woman in trouble.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI canât understand that,â said Sally. âIâve lived
round here all my life, and all the natives, white
and colored, will go to no end of trouble to help
a person out of a tight spot, âspecially women.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI figured he was no native, and up to some
skulduggery,â said Vera. âI went on down the
road and got Nancy Thompsonâs brother, and we
searched that creek with flashlights as far as we
could go.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd found nothing?â asked Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThat sneak had cleared out while I was gone.
If you ask me thereâs plenty happening on this
island thatâs not printed in the papers.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Secretly Kitty agreed with her. The incident
made her only more determined not to relax her
vigilance about certain peculiar people she was
watching.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>The next afternoon Kitty was waiting outside
Hazelâs door at the hospital promptly at four-thirty.
She soon heard the soft, but brisk step of
her friend coming down the hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>âCome in, while I freshen up a bit,â Hazel
invited.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty had never been in her new friendâs room,
and felt a little flutter of excitement as she went
inside. Hazel proffered the only rocker invitingly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>âYou sit there and rest a minute dear, while I
powder my nose and brush my hair. You look as
fresh as if you hadnât had your household to look
after all day.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI must admit I havenât had any idle moments,â
Kitty confessed.</p>

<p class='c011'>While Hazel was in the bathroom Kitty glanced
around the room that had been made so homelike
with many individual touches. On the dresser she
noticed a picture of a handsome man, evidently
slightly older than Hazel. Her heart sank with misgivings.
Perhaps Hazel was already engaged to
someone. For a moment she felt a pang of jealousy
and resentment. But she simply couldnât believe
Hazel would lead her father on if she were in love
with someone else.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhoâs the gorgeous-looking man?â she asked
frankly when Hazel returned to the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs my brother.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, yes, of courseâyour brother, Willard, Iâve
heard you speak about.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut how did you know his name? IâI never
mention him here.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThe day I met you in the launch Lieutenant
Cary spoke of him.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh-h!â Hazelâs tone became a degree cooler.
âHe used to be stationed here,â she added after a
moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSo Dad said. He was sent here in his place, I
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>understand.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI hope we donât live to regret his asking for
this post.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâyou mean Dad asked for this appointment?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, beg pardon. I thought you knew that.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo, I didnât. I knew nothing about it till Dad
wrote me he was coming to Palmetto Island, and it
would be a grand place for me and Billy to live.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Why had both her father and Hazel asked to
come here after the trouble Hazelâs brother had
had? To cover her confused thoughts Kitty took
the picture from the dresser and studied the face
frankly. Now she could see a resemblance to
Hazel. In that strong chin, firm mouth and the
wide frank eyes she could find no evidence of one
whose conduct might merit his being relegated to
some obscure Naval station.</p>

<p class='c011'>As she and Hazel went out to meet Ned Miller
in the lobby below she was more convinced than
ever that there was something mysterious going on,
in which her father was deeply involved.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hazel proved herself an understanding pal that
afternoon. She made it seem the most natural
thing in the world that Ned should want to see a
tiny baby. Kitty thought she had never seen anyone
so frightened and so awkward as Ned when he
first took that little blanketed form in his arms.
But with every passing minute his stiffness and
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>embarrassment grew less. Before their brief call
was over he had promised to carve the baby a
wooden bowl and spoon for his first eating.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI like to carve things,â he said. âI made one
for my own youngster two months ago.â</p>

<p class='c011'>He seemed to expand to new importance as he
spoke. When Kitty and Ned left together Hazel
stayed on for a longer visit with her friends. As
they drove away Kitty remarked, âI didnât notice
till this afternoon that youâre one of the boys who
work in the galley.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI like it pretty well there,â admitted Ned. âI
like doing things with my hands. Glad they didnât
put me where I have to work at a desk or anything
like that.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd it helps a lot when you like the people
you work with,â said Kitty, not without an ulterior
motive.</p>

<p class='c011'>âMy boss is fineâgood natured as they make
âem.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âKrome you mean? Chief Steward Krome?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOnly one trouble about himâhe snores like a
steam engine. You punch him and wake him up,
and he goes right back at it again.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIsnât there a thin, dark fellow named Punaro
down in the galley?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYeah! He collects waste from over the hospital
and does things like that. Looks after the kitchen
garbage too.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>âI saw him over at the USO the other night
playing chess with Lieutenant Cary.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Ned sent her an odd look and said, âYou did?â
After an interval he added diffidently, âIâm not the
kind to talk about people, Miss Kitty, but if you
were my sister I wouldnât want you to be letting
him take you home from Canteen, or anything
like thatânot Punaro!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThanks for the hint, Ned.â She wanted to ask
him more but didnât know how without betraying
those she felt she had no reason to suspect. They
parted in the lobby as Kitty turned off toward her
fatherâs office. But she thought how odd it wasâthat
at almost every contact she made, the tangled
web of clues she was picking up became more
bewildering.</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>

<div>  <span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span></div>
  <h2 id='title' class='c002'><span class='large'>CHAPTER EIGHT</span><br />Â <br /><span class='large'>WHATâS IN A TITLE?</span></h2>

<p class='c010'>When Kitty told Hazel about the shortage of
girls at the USO on that stormy night her friend
said, âStop by for me next time you go to Canteen.
My evenings are rather lonely. Iâll be glad to help
entertain the boys.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll have to get a card for you, but that wonât
be any trouble,â said Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>However, Hazelâs remark about her lonely evenings
left Kitty somewhat at sea. Her father was
away from home several evenings a week, and she
had thought he was spending them with Hazel.
Now she felt she had been mistaken.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next time Kitty was on duty at the Snack Bar
she went over to the hospital for Hazel, and together
they walked the five blocks to the USO hall.
As they walked along the main street in the twilight
they caught glimpses of the docks, with their
dimmed boat lights at each street intersection.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI love living here, donât you?â said Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âUnder different circumstances it would be quite
an interesting post.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âUnder different circumstances?â Kittyâs tone
implied her puzzlement.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>âIâm in rather an awkward spot, you know. My
brother had a very unpleasant time hereâwas
blamed for something of which he was innocent.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, Iâm sorry.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNaturally I still feel the cloud hanging over
me. Iâll never be quite happy till my brother is
cleared.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIs there anything I can do? I wish I could
help.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm afraid thereâs nothing anyone can do outside
the service.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty wanted to ask for more details, but the
tone of Hazelâs last remark suggested that the subject
was closed. In fact she felt very much surprised
that her friend had been as frank as she had
about the matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the USO hall they separated for a while,
Hazel to help amuse the boys while Kitty went
into the Canteen quarters. When she slipped off
her coat and put on her apron, she went out to
the bar to find Ned Miller waiting for her. He
seemed as bright as a sunny day after a long rainy
spell.</p>

<p class='c011'>âMiss Kitty, youâll never guess whatâs happened!â
he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYour wife and baby arenât flying to Palmetto
Island already?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, no, nothing so marvelous as that, but surprising
enough.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>âThen spill the news, Ned, and donât keep me
in suspense,â she encouraged.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThe Harpers have asked me to be godfather
for their son.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, Ned, thatâs super!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âImagine me a father and a godfather all in one
week!â</p>

<p class='c011'>Judy, Sally and Mrs. Evans drew nearer to add
their congratulations to Kittyâs.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâve all got to drink a hot chocolate with me
to celebrate,â continued Ned proudly. âItâs on me
this time!â</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Evans poured the chocolate, and topped it
with an unusually generous spoonful of whipped
cream.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThis is on the Canteen,â she said, and they all
made merry over the great event.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou must all come to the christening a week
from Sunday at the little chapel a block from the
hospital.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Hazel came presently and took Ned off for some
dancing. As Kitty watched them go there was a tender
light in her eyes. How happy she felt to realize
that she had made the sun break through the
fog for at least one boy!</p>

<p class='c011'>During a lull in business some time later she
drew up a stool and watched the activities in the
large hall. At the right in an open space around
the piano a dozen or more couples danced while a
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>marine kept the keys warm with his nimble fingers.
In the space directly in front of the bar were tables
where couples and foursomes played all manner of
games. Some boys lolled on couches or in large
armchairs with books or magazines, while others
sat at desks against the wall, writing letters home,
apparently unmindful of the confusion around
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently Kittyâs survey was checked as her gaze
came to rest once more on Lieutenant Cary playing
chess again. This time the players were sitting
so she could see the profiles of both men. Instantly
she recognized the physicianâs partner as
the dark-faced boy, Punaro, whom she had seen on
the bus that memorable night before the big fire
at the cannery.</p>

<p class='c011'>The last time she had noticed Cary here he was
playing with Chief Commissary Steward Krome.
She wondered why he was on such intimate terms
with the galley staff. Presently she was aware that
Hazel Dawson had returned to the bar and was
sitting on a stool across the counter.</p>

<p class='c011'>âDoes Lieutenant Cary come here very often?â
she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOnly occasionally.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDoes he always play chess with someone from
the galley?â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty sent Hazel a surprised glance. âYes, both
times Iâve seen him playing. The other night it
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>was the Chief Commissary Steward, Krome.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI can understand that. Krome has his rank.
But tonight he buddies with the boy who empties
our wastebaskets.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty bent closer and lowered her voice. âDo
you know anything about himâthe Punaro
fellow?â</p>

<p class='c011'>Hazel showed surprise at the question as she
countered, âWhy do you ask? Do you know anything
about him?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe was here the other night.â She thought of
adding that they had come home on the same bus
the night of the cannery fire, but caution silenced
her. There were too many around who might have
keen ears.</p>

<p class='c011'>Brad came in later.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâre almost a stranger,â Kitty greeted him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hazel went off with one of the boys who claimed
her for a dance, and Brad leaned closer.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI was too busy to come sooner, but I wanted to
get over here in time to see you home. Something
to tell you.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI brought Hazel with me. Weâll have to take
her back to the hospital before we can talk.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSure.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âGlad you came,â she added after a moment.
âYou can go with me to hunt up Chief Krome.
He promised me that shrimp creole recipe.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYeah! Sure, we want it for that picnic tomorrow.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>âThey say the only way you ever get a recipe out
of Krome is to go after it. He looks too easygoing
to let the mild matter of a promise like that weigh
on his mind.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSure is nice of you Canteen girls to go down on
the beach and fix that supper for us tomorrow.
Ned Millerâs looking forward to it, too. You sure
lifted his countenance, Kit.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty flushed. âOh, I guess I got as big a kick
out of it as he did.â There was an awkward pause
and she looked about for something to change the
subject. Finally she nudged Bradâs arm and whispered,
âTake a look over in the south corner at
those chess players.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Brad glanced at them and whistled softly. âThe
trail grows warmer, Kitty.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âFind out anything about Punaro?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âPlenty. But weâll save that till later. But when
you see two suspected ones hobnobbing it begins
to look as though something is brewing.â</p>

<p class='c011'>An hour before closing time Kitty saw the chess
players leave their board and go out. They hadnât
patronized the Snack Bar all evening.</p>

<p class='c011'>That was one night Kitty was glad when it was
time to go home. She had had no opportunity for
a private talk with Brad for some time, and she
had much on her mind. At the hospital they left
Hazel at her door and took the elevator down to
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>the basement.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSurely am glad you came along, Brad,â said
Kitty. âI wouldnât like to be hunting up Chief
Krome at this hour of the night by myself.â</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no one in sight when they got off the
elevator at the basement floor. âIâve never been
down here before,â Kitty remarked, as she followed
Brad toward the Chief Cookâs quarters.</p>

<p class='c011'>âQuite a nifty arrangement,â Brad explained.
âExtending out front this wing of the hospital is
a platform running right down to a dock over the
water. Supply boats come almost right up to the
building. Saves an awful lot in transportation of
fuel and food.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty felt no particular interest in what Brad
said. She was eager to get the recipe from Krome
and return to the street where she and Brad could
talk without fear of being overheard. Brad knocked
on Kromeâs door several times, but got no answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>âMust be out,â Kitty said, disappointed.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were about to turn away when Ned Miller
came running down the stairs. âLooking for
Krome?â he asked, seeing them outside the Chief
Cookâs door.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe promised me that shrimp creole recipe, and
they say Iâll have to run him down to get it,â
Kitty explained.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll go ask him for it for you,â offered Ned,
eager to be of service to Kitty. âI saw him up in
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>the recreation room as I came through, playing
chess with Lieutenant Cary.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, you did!â exclaimed Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Ned was already hurrying back toward the
stairs. They were about to follow when Brad said,
âCome, while weâre down here Iâll show you the
dock.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Not wanting to be rude enough to tell him it
didnât interest her in the least, Kitty followed Brad
toward the double doors that stood wide open at
the end of the cement passage. There was only a
shaded light outside. Her first impression was a
confused one of several barges huddled against the
dock piled high with boxes, crates, kegs and all
manner of freight.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then suddenly she saw a man at one of the
barges. Her pulse quickened when she noted it
was filled with refuse. The man had his back to
them, pushing something onto the barge. It seemed
to be a large box, but Kitty had only a glimpse for
the man threw a strip of old sail over it and turned
sharply at the sound of their footsteps. As he came
toward them there was indignation in his very
stride.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhat do you want here?â he growled.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he spoke and came nearer the glow from the
hallway, Kitty recognized Punaro, who less than an
hour ago had been playing chess in the USO hall
with Lieutenant Cary.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>âWeâre looking for Krome,â said Brad with aggravating
nonchalance.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHeâs not down here,â stated Punaro. âYouâll
find him up in the recreation room playing chess
with Dr. Cary.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThanks. Thanks a lot,â Brad said, and Kitty
wondered why his thanks was so profuse.</p>

<p class='c011'>When they went down the hall they found Ned
returning from above. âChief said if Iâd bring his
recipe book heâd find the thing you want and let
you copy it,â Ned explained. âHeâs just about to
checkmate Lieutenant Cary and canât leave his
game right now.â</p>

<p class='c011'>When Ned went into Kromeâs quarters Kitty
whispered to Brad, âDid you notice anything queer
out there?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âPlenty.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âPunaro throwing a strip of sail over a box on
the barge?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâd make a grand detective, Kitty!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd I noticed more, but weâd better wait till
we get outside to talk.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Lieutenant Cary sent them an unwelcome look
when they went upstairs, but Krome was quite
good-natured about the interruption. He handed
Kitty his own pen and a bit of notepaper on which
to write the recipe. He chuckled and advised her
to spice it up sharply for the boys.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>When at last they were outside in the cool moonlight
Kitty slipped her arm through Bradâs and
whispered, âThereâs something mighty queer going
on.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâre telling me!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI wouldnât trust that Punaro one minute! Iâll
bet you a hundred dollars heâs sneaking something
out of the hospital on that barge.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhat and where to, it now becomes our job
to find out.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDid you notice anything queer about his knowing
instantly where Krome was?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll say. It looks to me as though Cary got
Krome tied up in that chess game while Punaro
does what he pleases in the galley.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs a wise deduction, Mr. Holmes, but Dr.
Watson noticed something else.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Brad laughed in spite of his uneasiness. âIâd call
you the Sherlock Holmes and me Dr. Watson. You
were the first to begin picking up clues.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âStrange how so many things have come up to
make me know somethingâs wrong. Even Ned
Miller warned me the other day when I mentioned
Punaroâthat I mustnât ever let him bring me
home, that heâs not my kind.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNedâs in a position to know, Kitty, right down
there working with him. And say, this is what I
wanted to tell you up at the Snack Bar.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âGo ahead. Iâve been bustinâ to hear.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI noticed Punaroâs shoes the other day when
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>he came in to empty our wastebasket. Thereâs a
scorched streak across them, but heâs evidently
tried to polish it away.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd you really think it could have been caused
by a spark igniting spilled gasoline or kerosene?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âItâs possible, yes. But doing work like his, it
might have been spilled acid, too. Iâm afraid the
circumstantial evidence there is far too weak to
blame him for the cannery fire.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOf course. But later developments seem to
prove that my suspicions may not be entirely unfounded.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSay, you were going to tell me something else
you noticed out there just now.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDo you realize he called Cary, doctor, not
lieutenant?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâre rightâhe did!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âEverybody else round here calls him lieutenantâthose
whoâve only known him since he came into
the service.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll say your perception is very keen, Kitty. It
seems proof that Cary and Punaro knew each other
before they came into the service. Iâll try to find
out where they both hail from.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDo, Brad, if you can. This thing is beginning to
look very serious. Weâve got to find out what itâs
all about.â</p>

  <h2 id='marshes' class='c002'><span class='large'>CHAPTER NINE</span><br />Â <br /><span class='large'>INTO THE MARSHES</span></h2>

<p class='c010'>Kitty had so much on her mind that night she
couldnât sleep until after one oâclock. She didnât
even hear the alarm clock next morning, and was
roused by the sunlight streaming across her bed.
She pulled on her bathrobe and ran to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhat time is it?â she asked Jane.</p>

<p class='c011'>âEight oâclock. Yoâ Pah done et breakfus and
went to de horsepital.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy didnât you call me?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWaânât no use to bother you. You wus sleepinâ
jusâ like a sho nuff kitten.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut there was something special I wanted to
talk to Dad about this morning.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâll see him tonight.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut Iâm going with a bunch of Canteen workers
to fix supper for the boys on the beach late
this afternoon.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty had just started back to her room when
the phone rang. She found it was Hazel Dawson.</p>

<p class='c011'>âListen, dear, I heard you say once you always
go to town on Saturday morning,â came her
friendâs voice over the wire.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes, I do. Is there anything I can get you?â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>âIf it wouldnât be too much bother, Iâd like you
to get me a set of chessmen.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âA set of chessmen?â Kitty could not hide her
surprise. Chess had become intimately associated
in her mind with Cary and his partners.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hazel laughed. âIn my old age Iâve suddenly decided
to become a chess fan.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIt does seem to be quite a fad around here,â
admitted Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI havenât any way to get the money to you before
you go.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, thatâs all right,â said Kitty. âWhat price
do you want to pay?â She recalled that her grandfatherâs
ivory chessmen had been very valuable.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, the cheapest ones you can find will do for
me, plastic or wood will be all right. I only want
them so I can learn the game.â</p>

<p class='c011'>As Kitty put down the phone after this unusual
request, she wondered what was behind it. She had
no doubt that Hazelâs motive in learning the game
had some connection with Lieutenant Caryâs chess
playing. Yet the two made no pretense at friendship.</p>

<p class='c011'>Though she had missed her father at breakfast
Kitty was determined to see him before she went
to town, so she decided to go to the hospital. By
nine she had eaten breakfast and was ready for the
weekly shopping expedition.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIs you gwine to tek Billy to town wid you?â
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>asked Jane seeing Kitty dressed so early.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes. He has to have a new pair of shoes. Hope
I can get some non-rationed ones. Heâs already
used my last coupon.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDat boy can sho stomp out dem shoes.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâd better wake him up and give him breakfast
by the time I come back. Iâm going to run up
to the hospital to see Dad a few minutes.â</p>

<p class='c011'>All the guards and attendants at the hospital
knew Kitty as the daughter of the Chief Pharmacistâs
Mate. She always gave them a smile, a jaunty
salute and passed in without comment. A few minutes
later she slipped noiselessly into her fatherâs
office. He was busy going over some order sheets
with a junior officer, so Kitty sat down near the
door till he was at leisure.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSee you in a few minutes, Kitten,â her father
said when the petty officer went out and his stenographer
came up with some letters to be signed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty thought how wonderful it was to live
where she could occasionally drop in on her father
at his work. He had not finished the letters
when the door was opened wide and to her amazement
young Punaro stepped in and picked up her
fatherâs half-filled wastebasket. He didnât see her
till he turned to go back to the hall, where he had
left the large canvas-sided container which he
rolled along the halls to collect trash.</p>

<p class='c011'>By the ominous look he sent her she knew instantly
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>he recognized her as the same girl who
had come upon him unexpectedly at the galley
dock last night. Before he came back with the
empty basket her father called her to his desk.
He waited a moment till Punaro closed the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhatâs on your mind, Kitten?â he asked, dropping
his professional manner like a mask.</p>

<p class='c011'>âPlenty,â she said. âI donât like that Punaro
fellow coming into your office for one thing.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father threw back his head and laughed.
âNow, now, you mustnât be suspicious of everyone
who has a slightly olive cast to his complexion.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe has a very Italian name, too.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou seem to forget theyâre fighting on our
side now.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes, but some of them here are still friends of
the Hitlerites.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Knowing from experience that money could
often make a person forget unpleasant things Mr.
Carter took out his billfold. âGuess youâd like a
little change for the trip to town.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty laughed. âYouâve never known me to refuse
money, have you, Dad?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNot yet.â He handed her a bill. âYou might
get Billy that ball and mitt heâs been begging for.
Itâll soon be warm enough for him to play outdoors
all day. Maybe the ball will keep him from
climbing so many trees.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty smiled. âHeâs a regular monkey when it
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>comes to trees. When I take him to the park he
picks out the tallest and climbs up it like a cat.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm afraid Nina spoiled him, letting him climb
that old magnolia in our yard back home.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDear Aunt Nina, how I miss her.â Kitty sighed
as she put the money into her purse. âYours is the
second order for playthings Iâve had this morning.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy? Billy ordered something else?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNot Billy. Hazel Dawson wants me to get her
a set of chessmen.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHazel wants a set of chessmen,â he said, puzzled.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSeems to be getting quite a fad. Lieutenant
Cary plays every time he comes to the USO hall.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh.â Mr. Carterâs tone carried a world of
meaning.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOddly enough itâs generally with someone from
the galley. First it was Chief Krome and last
night it was that young fellow, Punaro, who was
in here just now.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kittyâs watching eyes caught the surprised look
that came into her fatherâs face.</p>

<p class='c011'>âDad, how long has Punaro been in the service?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI donât know. Two or three months, I imagine.â</p>

<p class='c011'>She felt he was annoyed with her, but couldnât
keep from saying, âIt doesnât take so many months
for them to show their true colors, does it?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy so much interest in this raw recruit?â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>âSome things have happened recently to stir
my curiosity,â she answered evasively. Her fatherâs
attitude repelled her further confidences, nor did
she feel this was the place to talk too much. But
she was determined to learn the one fact for which
she had come.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI must go now, Dad. But tell me one more
thing.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnything you want to know except military
secrets,â he replied, becoming playful again, because
she was so serious.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy do they haul the hospital refuse away on
a barge instead of burning it in the incinerator as
they do in other hospitals?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe had an explosion at the incinerator several
weeks ago. For some reason theyâve been slow in
getting it fixed.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI see,â said Kitty with a significant nod. âAnd
in the meantime I suppose the garbage is hauled
off somewhere in the marshes and burned?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs right.â Suddenly her fatherâs face became
very serious, and he sent her a penetrating
glance. âWhat are you driving at, Kitty, with all
these strange questions?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHavenât time to explain now,â she said evasively.
For so long Kitty had had to solve her own
problems, when her father was at distant stations,
that she had not yet learned how to make a confidant
of him. Nor did she want to run the risk of
having him put a stop to her investigations. But
she made bold to ask one further question.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>âDo you know where they haul the garbage,
Dad?â</p>

<p class='c011'>He led her to the window and pointed across the
marshes. âSee that smoke on the horizon.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYonderâway south?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs it. Thatâs where they burn it.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy so far away?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe couldnât stand the stench if it was too close.
Even at that distance a southwest wind will bring
the odor into my window. Iâll surely be thankful
when they use the incinerator again.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kittyâs mind was clicking like a teletype machine
as she left the hospital. She hadnât used their boat
in a week, and felt she was entitled to a little gasoline
for explorations.</p>

<p class='c011'>Billy looked forward to these weekly visits to
town with keen delight, so Kitty didnât have the
heart to curtail his enjoyment. They paid their
usual visit to the toy department at the dime store,
and took a peep at the ducks in Bayshore Park.
At noon they ate at a lunch counter, perched on
high stools, which Billy adored. Afterward Kitty
made her weekly food purchases at the grocery
store on Bay Street, opposite where she always left
her boat.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the grocery boy had packed her things
into the launch Kitty looked at Billy, gave him a
knowing wink and asked, âWant to go exploring?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, Kit, where?â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>âYouâll see. âWay into the marshes.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Billyâs eyes grew round. âInto a cove or somepen,
where pirates hide their booty?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo telling what weâll find âway off in the
marshes.â</p>

<p class='c011'>It was already one-thirty, and at five Vera was to
pick Kitty up for the trip to the beach. She would
have to do her exploring in that interval of time.
She had made a careful note of the location of
that smoke smudge on the horizon, as her father
pointed it out from his office. However, Kitty
didnât feel sufficiently familiar with the marshy
inlets to take a short cut to the spot. She decided
the safest course was to return near enough to
Palmetto Island to get her bearings from there, and
seek out the channel through which the barge
from the hospital traveled in going to the dump.</p>

<p class='c011'>âArenât we gonner explore?â Billy asked in a
disappointed tone when the smoke stacks of the
Marine Base came into view.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWeâre going to turn off into this inlet right
here,â Kitty reassured him.</p>

<p class='c011'>A bit of wind was blowing, making whitecaps
dot the deep green water. Though the weather was
pleasant enough ashore, there was a sharp tang on
the water that brought a glow to their cheeks.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the narrowing inlet southwest of Palmetto
Island, Kitty had to cut down her speed to keep
from running aground in the curving channel. She
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>had never been in this section of the marshes
before, and she thought how easy it would be to
get lost on the crisscross winding inlets that interlaced
the marshy islands. Most of these green mud
flats were treeless, but far off in the direction of
that smoke smudge, which was her destination, the
horizon was broken by palmettoes and pines.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhereâs the pirateâs lair?â Billy finally asked,
growing impatient to reach some destination.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWeâre almost there,â Kitty assured him. They
were near enough now to see two or three spirals
of smoke rising from a mound of rubbish dumped
on a sloping shore.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fortunately the wind was out of the east and
carried smoke away from them, so Kitty had a clear
view of the dump. She shivered to see buzzards
circling above the smoking pile of refuse. What a
fitting place, she thought, for spies to meet for their
diabolical planning! Had some foreign agent met
Punaro here this morning to take away that box
of supplies she had noticed on the barge?</p>

<p class='c011'>As she drew nearer she saw the rubbish was
burning on an old oyster reef off the north end of
a large island. The southern side was densely overgrown
with palmettoes, pines, oaks and a tangled
thicket of mangroves along shore.</p>

<p class='c011'>âGet out the field glasses, Billy,â she ordered
âand weâll see if we can find any pirates.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh-h!â gurgled Billy. He made a dive for the
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>stern locker where they kept odds and ends. It was
all wonderful make-believe to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty had slowed the launch, and before she
took the glasses she cut off the motor and let the
boat drift. A quick survey of the dump heap made
her want to explore, even if it was a repulsive spot,
but that was out of the question with Billy along.
She was afraid to come even this close for fear he
would pick up some germ. The very thought made
her hand him the glasses and start the motor again.</p>

<p class='c011'>Though it was already growing late she decided
to take a turn around the small island. She was
glad she had taken the chance when she reached
the opposite side. There she found a deep, open
channel, moving eastward toward the sea. Billy
kept looking through the glasses toward the island
while Kitty studied the channel.</p>

<p class='c011'>âLooks deep enough to float a sub,â she thought.</p>

<p class='c011'>âKit, letâs go home!â exclaimed Billy, sudden
terror in his voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI saw somebody looking at us from the woods
yonder. Maybe it was a pirate.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Though Kitty took the glasses from her small
brotherâs hands she could see nothing in the mangrove
jungle. Had it been only his vivid imagination,
or had he seen someone? However, she did
not tarry to find out as she gave her motor all the
power it would take and headed for home.</p>

  <h2 id='party' class='c002'><span class='large'>CHAPTER TEN</span><br />Â <br /><span class='large'>THE BEACH PARTY</span></h2>

<p class='c010'>It was four oâclock by the time Kitty came
ashore on Palmetto Island at a landing spot a
block behind her house. She sent Billy home with
an armful of bundles to bring Jane down to help
with the unloading.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was many a job to be done in the next
hour, but Kitty had learned how to make every
minute count. She put the groceries in the closet
and the perishable food in the ice box, she planned
the evening meal for her father and Billy, and had
just put on her slacks when Vera drove up and
honked the horn.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was nice to sit back, temporarily free of responsibility,
and enjoy her ride across the island
with the competent Vera at the wheel. In the
basket at her feet were the ingredients for Chief
Kromeâs famous shrimp creole, all except the
shrimp which the boys were at that moment catching.</p>

<p class='c011'>The drive to the beach carried them over a half
dozen bridges, spanning marshy inlets. Finally
they rolled off the pavement into a sand-rutted
road, winding through a palmetto thicket. The
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>station wagon turned off finally to the hard beach,
and they rolled along within a few feet of the
tumbling breakers.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Kitty looked across the blue-green water mottled
with whitecaps, she found it difficult to believe
that enemy subs might, at that very moment,
be lurking in the cool depths.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSomebody sent down a boat off shore in the
last twenty-four hours,â said Sally. âLook at that
oily scum on the water, and the junk floating
ashore.â</p>

<p class='c011'>The receding tide had left part of a water-soaked
bunch of bananas right in their path, while crates,
bottles, empty boxes and splintered timbers bobbed
up and down on the tide.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe have just three hours to fix our chow, eat
and get out of here,â said Vera, âor Iâll never get
through that sandy road without lights.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI suppose it is too close to the beach to use
headlights in there,â said Judy.</p>

<p class='c011'>They all knew that no lights were permitted
anywhere along the entire shore, and that the
beach was even more carefully patrolled at night
than in the day.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI donât care to get stuck on a sandy road
again,â said Vera.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were to meet the boys a mile downshore
where an inlet cut through the beach to join the
sea. The boys had already been shrimping a couple
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>of hours in the shallows of this inlet. When
the station wagon turned a sharp bend in the
beach the girls saw a curl of smoke rising beyond
a large sand dune that shielded the light of the
campfire from possible watchers at sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>Vera had to keep the car to a narrow strip of
beach between the rolling dry dunes and the breakers.
When the boys saw them pull up behind the
dune they came trotting over to help unload.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWeâve got the nicest mess of shrimp you ever
saw,â boasted Ned Miller proudly.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHow long have you been here?â asked Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âLong enough to catch something more than
shrimp,â retorted Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâre not ahead of us,â Sally told them. âWe
saw rubbish washing up all along shore. A U-boat
must have hit somebody out there.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe donât claim weâve located the U-boat,â admitted
Ned, âbut we did find an old bateau hidden
under some mangroves.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAt least five miles from any habitation,â added
Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, I thought they had something,â said Vera
with a laugh. âIf you had lived in this part of the
country as long as I have, youâd be used to bateaux
and old boats in all sorts of nooks.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty watched Bradâs face intently during this
exchange, and finally their eyes met. His expression
implied that he would tell her more later.
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>There was no opportunity, however, in the next
hour for them to talk privately. The boys were already
preparing the shrimp for the pot, and Kitty
quickly mixed the other ingredients.</p>

<p class='c011'>The shrimp creole was soon cooking. In the
meantime they sat on the sands around the campfire.
Its warm glow was more than welcome in the
biting salt air. Jimmy Barnes amused them with
a hair-raising tale while they waited.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThe beach guard stopped to chat with us a few
minutes ago,â Jimmy began.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Coast Guard Station was several miles down
the coast from the Marine Base. Kitty had seen
very little of those men since she came to Palmetto
Island.</p>

<p class='c011'>âJim asked the chap if he didnât get lonesome
down here,â put in Ned.</p>

<p class='c011'>ââLonesome,â said the guard, âwhy man, Iâve got
a box seat at the livest show in America.â Then he
told us something thatâll make your eyes pop,â
explained Jimmy. âAbout a week ago he said a sub
was hit right in sight of Palmetto Island, and youâd
never guess what they found aboard.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âCut out the suspense, Ned, and tell us what,â
Vera ordered.</p>

<p class='c011'>âFresh bread wrapped in Bayshore Bakery
paper.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo, not really!â exclaimed Kitty, recalling her
interesting visit to the bakery, and the spicy little
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>cakes each nutrition student had been given as a
souvenir.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOf course nobody can blame the Bayshore Bakery,â
Jimmy hastened to say. âBut it only goes to
show that the U-boats are getting all sorts of supplies
from our own towns. They say that bread was
freshâcouldnât have been more than a day old.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âItâs hard to believe such things are going on,â
said Lana Bright, her big brown eyes wide as she
glanced anxiously toward the eastern horizon.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the good old days there had always been
steamers or small craft on the horizon, but now
every ship that passed must be convoyed for protection
against subs. Sally and Lana had been
brought up on the southern coast and found it
hard to realize that a death-dealing enemy could
encroach on their childhood playground, as they
had always considered the beach.</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd thatâs still happening even after most people
feel weâve practically got the U-boat situation
in hand,â commented Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes, and when we take the complacent attitude
that weâve got any of this war business under control
and sit down on the job thereâs bound to be
trouble,â stated Brad.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThat Coast Guard chap also told us about those
oil tankers that were attacked right off this very
shore last week,â continued Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI heard the firing!â exclaimed Kitty. âAt first
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>I thought it was thunder, but Dad said when he
came home that a U-boat had been sunk out here.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd the guard saw the whole works,â Ned told
them eagerly. âHe said the tankers were going
down-coast when the sub attacked them. In two
minutes he had the Coast Guard Station over his
walkie-talkie, and ten minutes later our planes were
dropping depth bombs. And boy, they got that
sub! Iâd have given anything to be down here!
Makes me wish Iâd gone into the Coast Guard!â</p>

<p class='c011'>After hearing all this Kitty felt still more uneasy
about her experience earlier in the afternoon.
Could it be possible that the man Billy had seen
on the island was the same who owned that boat
hidden in the mangroves? She had noticed no boat
herself, but one certainly could have been hidden
in the dense shrubbery that overhung the water.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty was relieved when their supper was ready,
and the hungry boys had been served. Vera poured
the hot coffee, and Sally supplied them with fresh
bread from the Bayshore Bakery.</p>

<p class='c011'>âMakes you feel sort of funny, eating this bread
and knowing the Germans have recently eaten
bread out of the same kind of wrappers,â said
Kitty, giving Brad a significant look as she handed
him a high-piled plate.</p>

<p class='c011'>âLetâs sit over on that palmetto log,â he suggested
when she picked up her own plate.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>Other couples had paired off, and Kitty was
glad that at last she had a chance to talk privately
with Brad.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhat about that boat you saw?â she asked in a
low tone when they were seated.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWish the others hadnât spread the news
around.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDo you think it has any connection with the
mysterious business weâre trailing?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThereâs no telling. If it leaks out at the hospital
that people are getting wise to the skulduggery
it may put a temporary stop to the dirty business
and throw us off the trail.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhere did you see that boat?â Kitty asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSouth end of that islandâopposite where
theyâre burning the hospital waste.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kittyâs fork stopped in mid-air, and she stared
speechless at Brad a moment. âWhy Brad, I passed
that very spot today.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou?â he exclaimed incredulously. âWhat were
you doing there alone?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNot alone. Billy was with me.â Briefly she
gave him an account of her day, beginning with
the conversation in her fatherâs office. âBrad, Iâm
convinced Punaro is smuggling something out of
the hospital with the garbage. Who knows but
what heâs the one keeping these U-boats supplied
with fresh bread, green vegetables and stuff like
that.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âTheyâre getting it from somewhere, and thatâs
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>a certainty,â stated Brad. He was silent a moment,
then said anxiously, âBut Kitty, you shouldnât
have gone off there in the marshes alone.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBilly was with me. You forget I was practically
brought up in a boat, Brad. Iâm never afraid on
the water.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut itâs dangerous now. Promise me, Kit, you
wonât ever go off like that alone again.â</p>

<p class='c011'>She laughed at his fears, but her pulse beat a
little faster because of his solicitude.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI may have to sometime, Brad. But Iâll promise
to be more careful.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy, anything could have happened to you.
That man could have fired from the mangroves,
and nobody would ever have known what had become
of you two.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut I had to know where that barge took the
stuff, what the general situation was. I didnât even
think about being nervousâthat is, not till Billy
told me about seeing the man through our glasses.â</p>

<p class='c011'>They were silent while they finished their supper,
then Kitty said, âBrad, Iâve always heardâthat
spies come ashore from the subs in rubber boats.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSo they do.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut didnât Jimmy say the one they saw was an
old bateau?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSo it was. Maybe thatâs the boat that comes out
to meet the enemy boats. Weâve already caught
several of the native fishermen round here in the
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>pay of enemy spies. No doubt thereâre still plenty
of others free and active.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIt seems incredible that anyone could be so unpatriotic
and low.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou donât know people like I do, Kit. Plenty
of people will sell their very souls for a little
money.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut the risks they take! How do they get away
with it?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâd be surprised if you knew. Why, when we
first went to war fishing boats all along the coast
were supplying German subs with gasoline right
under the nose of the authorities.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd all of us so skimped for gasoline!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThen the government took over most of the
fishing boats, and conditions improved.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty leaned closer and said with determination,
âAnd Brad, weâre going to put a stop to the dirty
work going on at our hospital! If I canât give all
my time to my country maybe I can help in this
way.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm afraid weâve got a big job, Kit. But every
day I become more certain that thereâs something
going on round there that is really bad.â</p>

<p class='c011'>She glanced at him sharply. âAnything new
turned up?â</p>

<p class='c011'>He nodded. âIt may or may not be important.
I talked to Ivy, the man who looks after the incinerator.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>âOh! Do you think heâs working with Punaro
and maybe Lieutenant Cary?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo, I donât. I believe Ivyâs on the level if ever
a man was. Heâs terribly upset over not being able
to get the incinerator fixed. He says repair parts
have come twice, and both times they didnât fit.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSomebody at the factory is trying to hold up
the repairs?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âLooks that way. And Ivy swears the explosion
in the incinerator was the work of saboteurs. Poor
fellow, he almost got a bob-tail for it himself. If
he hadnât had such a wonderful record for five
years back I guess he would have.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhat do you think all this adds up to, Brad?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSeems plain as the nose on a manâs face. The
incinerator is kept out of order to give a free hand
to the spies in getting the stuff out of the hospital
and into the marshes, where it can be picked up
by the enemy.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty felt the goose flesh prickle along her spine.
She had never dreamed when she came to Palmetto
Island and went into Canteen work that she would
find herself in the midst of such dangerous intrigue.</p>

  <h2 id='island' class='c002'><span class='large'>CHAPTER ELEVEN</span><br />Â <br /><span class='large'>TERRAPIN ISLAND</span></h2>

<p class='c010'>Kitty saw her father reading the evening paper
as Brad brought her home about nine oâclock.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWonât you come in?â she asked, though she
knew her voice betrayed her weariness.</p>

<p class='c011'>âNot tonight. Youâve had a full day and better
get some rest.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI am tired,â she admitted, but she felt a glow
of happiness that he was so understanding.</p>

<p class='c011'>âGuess your dad is sort of lonesome. Heâll want
to hear all about what youâve been doing. He
wouldnât like it, Kit, if he knew what chances
youâve been taking.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo, I suppose not,â she admitted. âIâd better
be careful what I say, or he may try to stop my
Sherlock Holmes business.â</p>

<p class='c011'>When she went into the living room her father
glanced over the top of his paper. âEnjoy your
trip to the beach?â he asked, still somewhat preoccupied.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIt was wonderful. Almost like old times.â She
sat on a footstool near him, and took off the kerchief
that had bound up her hair. All the girls
had worn slacks and kerchiefs for the picnic instead
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>of their Canteen uniforms.</p>

<p class='c011'>âA boatâs been sunk offshore. The beach was full
of wreckage.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes. One went down not far from here yesterday.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI had no idea so many were still being sunk.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âFar more than get into the papers.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOne of the boys told us about them capturing
a sub that had fresh bread on it from Bayshore
Bakery. That seems incredible!â</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father let his paper slide to his lap and
reached for his pipe. âOh, theyâre getting supplies
all the timeâfood, gasoline, and many other
things, no doubt.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âCanât they put a stop to it?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNot as long as weak human beings can be
bribed by the glint of gold.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd for other reasons, too. Do you suppose
any men are in our Army and Navy who are agents
of the Nazis and Japs?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âCertainly not, Kit,â her father answered, then
added a bit dubiously. âWell, I suppose it could
happen. In an organization as large and as rapidly
built as this, one might slip through. But you may
be sure they would not stay long, for with our intelligence
service, their activities would soon be
brought to light.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut sometimes even high officials are new men,
havenât been in longâlike the doctors they recruit.â
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>Kitty was thinking definitely of Lieutenant
Cary, but didnât mention his name.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes, of course. They have to give a man of that
caliber a commission.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd right away theyâre put into positions of
authority where they can help the enemy, if theyâve
a mind to.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes, of course. But, as I said, they soon show
their colors.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father paused, his match halfway to his
pipe as he looked at her searchingly. âBut why all
this interest in such things, Kitten? Youâve become
a walking question-box.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, the talk you pick up makes you wonder
about lots of things,â she replied evasively. âAfter
I asked you this morning about the disposal of
the waste I got to wondering what they do with
all the food scraps.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father looked surprised at such a question
and repeated, âFood scraps?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI often see the ward boys dumping food left
by the patients into big buckets.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, that. Itâs contracted for by a cattleman.
Beeson, I believe his name is. He lives on Terrapin
Island, and uses the waste to feed his hogs.â</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>Next morning Brad came by to go to church
with Kitty. As they were walking home together
she asked, âBrad, do you know where Terrapin
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>Island is?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo, but I can find out. Up at the hospital they
have some very fine, detailed maps of every island
and inlet along this coast.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSoundings, too, and water depths?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI should think so. I never studied them closely.
They were done by some boys over at the
Marine Baseâfellows who used to work for the
Coast Geodetic Survey.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWish I could have a look at them.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âMight stir up some comment, Kit. No use to
lay ourselves open to questioning.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo, of course not.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhat did you want to look up specially?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI was wondering yesterday when I went exploring
if that inlet flowing around the south end of
that island is deep enough to float a sub.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Brad laughed. âYou can put that worry out of
your mind, Kit. Any inlet along this coast thatâs
deep enough to float a sub is thoroughly guarded
and protected by netting at the sea entranceâunder
water of course.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut thatâs no assurance that small rubber boats
canât come in for supplies.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, no, nor that traitors from our shores canât
slip out to waiting subs. And, of course, we know
thatâs being done all the time.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBrad, wouldnât it be wonderful if you and I
could do something to nip that sort of thing in the
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>bud?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âKit, donât be too sure we can do anything about
it. Weâre dealing with clever crooks, with devilishly
keen minds.â</p>

<p class='c011'>A few minutes later when Brad paused at Kittyâs
door she said, âCanât you come in and have
dinner with us? Jane always fixes something a
little extra because Dad eats dinner with us at
noon on Sundays.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâre a peach, Kit! It really would feel good
to stick my feet under a home table once more.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Carter made Brad welcome while Kitty went
back to have Jane set an extra place at the table.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were half through dinner when Billy said,
âDad, letâs go boat riding. You promised to take
me some time.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSo you did, Dad, as soon as the weather was
mild enough. It couldnât be a more perfect day
to get out.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Carter glanced at Brad and said, âThey forget
a warâs on, and we have to use gasoline
sparingly.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhatâs wrong with a bit of rowing?â suggested
Brad. âA little exercise like that would do me
good.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWouldnât do me any harm either,â agreed Mr.
Carter. âI sit in my office so much my muscles are
getting flabby.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHow about asking Hazel?â Kitty suggested.
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>âSheâs been wanting to explore these marshes a
long time.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âA brilliant idea, Kitten!â Her father showed
real interest now. âWe can catch the rising tide up
into the marshes and come back when it turns.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Brad laughed. âThat method will certainly be
much easier on the muscles.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Hazel had the day off and was delighted at the
prospect of spending the afternoon out in the
sunshine.</p>

<p class='c011'>âTell her Iâll call for her at two-thirty,â Mr.
Carter told Kitty as she phoned.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâll give me half an hour to run up to the
hospital,â said Brad. âThere is something I must
attend to up there before I leave.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThen Iâll have time to pack some sandwiches
and cookies, so we can eat our supper outdoors.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnother brilliant idea,â said her father. âWeâll
make an afternoon of it.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThat will give Jane the whole afternoon off.
She needs a rest,â said Kitty, as she hurried out to
the kitchen to see what she could prepare on such
short notice.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a long loaf of Bayshore Bakery bread
that hadnât been opened. While she made chicken
sandwiches from dinner left-overs she thought how
strange it seemed to be eating bread from the same
bakery as that eaten by the Nazis off shore. As she
worked she wondered also what had taken Brad
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>back to the hospital.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father had already left in his car to bring
Hazel from the hospital when Brad came back and
bolted on into the pantry.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI made a little sketch from that big map,â he
told Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSo thatâs what you went for?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThought we might have a chance to look up
Terrapin Island while weâre out,â he said. âCome,
let me show you.â</p>

<p class='c011'>He spread a hasty sketch on the dining-room
table.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâve been wondering if Terrapin Island is near
the place where they burn the hospital waste.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âItâs the very next island, see!â Brad traced with
his finger the inlet that swung southwest around
Palmetto Island, and farther south separated Terrapin
Island from its neighbor, which they discovered
was called Mangrove Island.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>Two hours later the picnickers came ashore on
an island covered with virgin pines. By subtle
suggestions Kitty and Brad had succeeded in heading
their expedition toward the goal they had in
mind. Mr. Carter and Hazel had no particular
purpose but to enjoy the sunshine and bracing air,
and so were amenable to suggestions. Kitty and
Hazel insisted on doing their share of the rowing,
so the trip was easy for all.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>Billy was hilarious when they climbed up the
bank to a deep carpet of pine needles under the
towering trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, Daddy, letâs stay here a long time and
play!â he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe can stay two whole hours before we start
back. Thatâs a very long time.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI never saw such magnificent trees,â said Hazel.
Her eyes turned here and there as if she could not
take in enough of the beauty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd smell the fragrance of the sun on the
pine needles,â said Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âA wise old Hindu told me once that man can
gain renewed vitality in a pine grove quicker than
anywhere else,â Mr. Carter told them.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThen anybody ought to live forever here,â
said Brad.</p>

<p class='c011'>None of them had ever seen such a virgin forest.
There was very little underbrush, just the towering
pines rising from their thick carpet of brown
needles, their green tops nodding against a blue
sky, with a sweet sighing in the gentle breeze.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThis carpet of brown needles doesnât look as
though a human foot had been set here for half a
century,â remarked Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âTheyâre protected from the sea winds by that
island to the east,â said Mr. Carter. As he glanced
that way his expression changed. âI do believe
weâve landed behind the island where they burn
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>the hospital refuse.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Brad glanced at Kitty, but neither admitted that
this was where they wanted to land. Billy picked
up a branch for a gun and began to play Indian.</p>

<p class='c011'>âDo you think this is really Terrapin Island?â
Kitty asked in a low tone when she and Brad
strolled off toward the eastern shore.</p>

<p class='c011'>He took out his little map, and they studied it.</p>

<p class='c011'>âCanât be any other,â he said. âThereâre smoke
smudges yonder. Must be the dump heap. Weâre
directly west of it.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut thereâs no sign of a hog range here.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThe map indicates itâs a rather large island
compared with many others round here. The hogs
may be at the other end. These islands are often
broken up by low lands that fill at high tide.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBrad, do you suppose this Beeson could be helping
get stuff to the German subs, too?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIt all looks very suspicious to me, Kit. Here he
is living right next to where the dump is. We
have every reason to doubt Punaroâs loyalty. Heâs
obliged to have dealings with this hog raiser when
he comes to get the stuff from the galley. You
canât help judging people by those theyâre closely
associated with.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Billy trailed after them as they picked their way
along the eastern shore to the island. On this side
there was a low bluff. Kitty glanced back to note
that her father and Hazel were sitting under a pine
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>in sight of their boat. She and Brad continued
tramping down the eastern shore. When they had
gone about a half mile they saw an old negro fishing
from the bluff. On stiff-jointed knees he got
to his feet as they approached.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHowdy,â he said, with the genuine courtesy of
the old southern negro. âYâall lookinâ fer somebody?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, no,â said Brad. âWe just came out here on
a little boat ride and for a picnic supper.â</p>

<p class='c011'>The old man took off his battered felt and
scratched his woolly head. âReckon yâall bettah go
someâers else to eat yoâ suppah. Massa donâ like
nobody in the pine grove. Reckon you see dem
sign he stick up.â</p>

<p class='c011'>They had noticed âNo trespassingâ signs, but
Kitty had thought that applied to hunting and
fishing.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe arenât doing a bit of harm,â Kitty told the
old man. âThe trees are so beautiful. Thereâs no
reason why we shouldnât enjoy them.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYasâm, dat so, but jusâ de same boss donât like
nobody meddlinâ round the pine thicket. Might
set foire anâ buân it up.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe arenât going to cook anything. We brought
a cold lunch. And if we did make a fire weâd put
out every spark.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYasâm, dat whut I tell him too. I been libinâ
all mah life in dat shack yonder.â The old man
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>indicated a log cabin in a clearing a little farther
south. âI ainât neber sot foire to de woods. But
he canât be satisfy when he lease de place lasâ year
till I come to lib in dat new house behind his.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, he only rented the island last year?â asked
Brad.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYessuh! Anâ I has to be powerful keerful âbout
whut I does since he been here. I wouldnât be
down here fishinâ me mah ole fish place, âcept he
gone to town fer de day.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSo youâre enjoying yourself while heâs gone,â
said Kitty kindly.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYasâm. I shoâ gits lonesome fer de ole times
anâ de easy ways, âfore dis island was a hog lot.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, so your boss is the man who gets the
refuse from the hospital?â asked Brad.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYassuh. I ainâ neber see so much slop since I
been born. In de ole days my Massa wouldnât ov
tetched he hand to sich wuk, but not Mr. Beeson.
He go fer dat stuff all de time hisself.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty thought the old man looked to be eighty
or ninety. His bloodshot eyes were deeply sunken
in his wrinkled dusty brown face, while his once-large
frame had little padding left on the bones.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIt was nice of Mr. Beeson to let you continue
to live here after he rented the island,â Kitty remarked,
hoping to draw him out further.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYassum, but he canât heâp hisseâf. Massaâs son,
up nawth, whut own de island all dese years, say
he wonât rent to nobody, lessen I kin stay here de
resâ oâ mah days anâ lib in peace.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâd be glad to write for you,â Kitty offered.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was strangely drawn to this old man, not
only because of the hints he had let slip to throw
more light on the mystery they were trying to
solve, but because she knew he represented the
best of a forgotten era in the south.</p>

<p class='c011'>âDat moighty kind oâ you, liâl Missie, but I donât

<p class='c011'>âBrad, do you have a pencil and a bit of paper?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSure,â said Brad, producing what she desired.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou give me his full name, uncleââ</p>

<p class='c011'>âUncle Mose all de chillun in de fambly calls

<p class='c011'>âGive me your sailorâs full name and Iâll try to

Tradd. De besâ blood in all de low country flows

<p class='c011'>Kitty wrote down the name and said, âIt may
take some time, but Iâll come back to see you if I
can find out where he is.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âLawdy, Missie, hit good to talk to real quality
folk like yâall once more. You shoâ put me in mind
oâ ole Massaâs bride when he brung her home to
de island. Youâs as much like her as two peas in
a pod.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThank you,â said Kitty, and curtsied as she
knew the old-fashioned girls used to do. âWe must
be going now, but weâre glad we met you.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIt do a lonely old man good to talk to folks
like you,â he said with a respectful bow. âI ainât
got nothinâ but memories to live wid now.â</p>

<p class='c011'>When he was out of hearing Brad whistled softly,
âKit, Iâll have to hand it to you for learning a
lot from him. You worked your way right into his
heart and found out plenty.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, really, Brad, I didnât purposely treat him
nice just to pick him. I warmed to him the minute
I saw him. Heâs the real thing.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou bet!â</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly Kitty stopped short, and exclaimed,
alarm in her tone, âBrad, whereâs Billy?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy, Iâd forgotten about him!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI did too. I havenât seen him since long before
we met the old man.â Kitty ran ahead into the
pine grove calling, âBilly! Billy, where are you?â</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c000' />

<div>  <span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span></div>
  <h2 id='lookout' class='c002'><span class='large'>CHAPTER TWELVE</span><br />Â <br /><span class='large'>THE LOOKOUT</span></h2>

<p class='c010'>Kitty had never felt so conscience-stricken in her
life as when she found Billy was lost.</p>

<p class='c011'>âMaybe he went back and joined your father
and Miss Dawson,â Brad suggested.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI donât think so. Weâd come too far. He trailed
us all the way, pretending to be shooting at us
from behind trees. Oh, Brad, do you suppose he
fell from that bluff into the water?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut he can swim like a fish.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou go along the bluff and Iâll go through the
thicket,â she directed.</p>

<p class='c011'>She ran from him, darting here and there, calling
frantically. If anything had happened to Billy
she would never forgive herself for being so preoccupied
with this strange jig-saw puzzle she and
Brad were trying to work out.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly she stopped short under the towering
pines, tears streaming down her eyes. âOh, Billy
darling, where are you?â she wailed. âKitty will
die if anything has happened to you.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly she caught the queer little noise he
made in his throat when pretending to fire a machine
gun at her. She glanced around, startled.
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>He was nowhere in sight. That must have been
something she heard, because she so wanted to
hear it.</p>

<p class='c011'>âBilly,âwhere are you?â she called almost desperately.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again there came the playful sound, and this
time Kitty thought it was overhead. She must be
having hallucinations surely. Hopefully she moved
in the direction from which she thought the sound
had come. Suddenly a cone fell almost at her feet.
Then there was a burst of childish laughter from
the nearest treetop. She looked up to see a mischievous
face peering down at her from the high
branches. Her overwhelming relief was only momentary,
for it was followed by terror lest Billy
break his neck.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy, Billy Carter, how in the world did you
climb that tall pine?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIt was easy. Come up, Kit. You can see clear
across the world.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm not coming up, and youâre coming down
this very instant,â she said firmly.</p>

<p class='c011'>âItâs fun up here! Let me stay,â pleaded Billy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty saw Brad running toward them, attracted
by their voices.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, look at him! In the top of that pine,â she
told Brad. âHow will he ever get down?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI can get down,â stated Billy, unexpectedly
willing to show them the wonderful feat.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>With the agility of a little monkey he swung
through the wide-spreading branches that crowned
the towering column of rusty brown. Kittyâs hands
were clenched agonizingly as he reached the smooth
trunk, which had no supporting branches.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, dear God, bring him down safely,â she
prayed. Seeing Brad take a step toward the tree,
she whispered, âDonât speak to him or make him
nervous.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Then they saw an amazing thing. Billyâs feet
were seeking small niches cut in the trunk, and
his hands holding to something that hugged the
bark.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI do believe there is wire wrapped all the way
up that trunk,â whispered Brad, noting that she
had seen it too.</p>

<p class='c011'>âPut there so somebody could climb up and
down that tree easily,â added Kitty. But at the
moment she did not stop to realize how significant
it might be. She was too grateful to know it
was there to make Billyâs descent less dangerous.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thirty feet above the ground the sturdy limbs
of a young oak spread around the pine trunk. Billy
stepped lightly to those limbs and a few minutes
later had scrambled safely to the ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty caught him to her, moaning, âOh, Billy
darling, you might have broken your neck! Never
do such a thing again.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHuh!â he grunted, resenting being made a
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>baby. âIt was funâlike climbing our old magnolia
back in Nâ Orleans. Aunt Nina let me play up
there any time.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm afraid Aunt Nina spoiled you terribly.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Billy stepped back and surveyed the tree with a
proud air. âI never went so high before. You can
see the ocean off yonder.â He swung his arm seaward
with a grandiose air. âThe hospital, too.
There was even a seat to sit on.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âA seat!â exclaimed Brad. âYou mean boards
nailed across the limbs to make a seat?â</p>

<p class='c011'>Billy nodded. âI sat on it. The wind swings the
top. It was fun. I was a bird up there!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âKitty, Iâm going up!â Brad said, with sudden
decision. âSomebody has a lookout here.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh!â The very idea seemed to take Kittyâs
breath away.</p>

<p class='c011'>A moment later Brad was scaling the tree by
the route Billy had taken.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe can climb âmost as good as me,â boasted
Billy. âIâm going up, too.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIndeed, youâre not! Youâre never going to
climb such a high tree again.â</p>

<p class='c011'>While Billy picked up his imaginary gun once
more and played at shooting them, Kittyâs mind
was in turmoil. Finding this tree lookout was certainly
a sequel to what Uncle Mose had told them.
It seemed quite obvious that the man who had
leased Terrapin Island wanted to be sure that this
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>end of the estate was kept entirely private, even
to the extent of moving an ignorant old negro from
his life-long home.</p>

<p class='c011'>âCan you see very far?â she asked, when Brad
reached the top.</p>

<p class='c011'>âPlenty. The highest lookout that could be
found in the entire marshes.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty felt sure he must be right, for the ancient
pine looked to be the father of all the pines in
the entire thicket.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Brad again stood beside her on the cushiony
brown carpet of needles he said, âKitty, that
wire has been strung up there recently.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHow do you know?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âItâs still loose, and not embedded in the trunk
anywhere.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou must be right. Even wisteria vines growing
around pine trunks soon press tightly into
them.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âKitty, Iâm sure glad we headed for this spot.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâre telling me! The minute Dad told me
Beeson came over to the hospital to haul stuff off
for his swine I thought he might be mixed up in
the dirty business.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âEvidence is piling up bit by bit.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âLooks as though we ought to be able to bring
âem to justice sometime soon.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut when you come to think of it, Kit, we
havenât got a single thing that would really convict
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>anybody of anything.â</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked puzzled and distressed. âThatâs true,â
she had to admit. âJust because some Bayshore
Bakery bread was found on that sub, and because
we saw a nailed-up box on a trash barge doesnât
prove anything about âwho dunnit.ââ</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd just because thereâs an easy way to climb
this pine that has a seat at the top doesnât prove
that anybody on this island is a spy.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOf course boys have been building seats in
trees for hundreds of years. Maybe it was old
Uncle Moseâs young âMassaâ when he was last
here.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNot very likely. That seat was put up there so
recently that the nails arenât even rustyâand you
know that doesnât take long in this salty air. And
whatâs more, thereâs a boarded up shield on the
side toward the Marine Base. Itâs so cleverly camouflaged
youâd hardly know it from the groundâsee.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Only after Brad pointed it out did Kitty see the
brown painted wood in the thick upper branches.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIf they are using light signals for subs out at
sea the Coast Guard would surely see them from
the beach,â said Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThey probably donât use lights, but some other
signal code.â</p>

<p class='c011'>They walked slowly toward their landing place
and Kitty let Billy run ahead to join her father
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>and Hazel.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe can hardly wait to tell them about climbing
the pine,â Brad said.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe canât keep him from telling that,â said
Kitty, âbut letâs not mention how significant that
pine seems. IâIâm afraid Dad may forbid my nosing
about. I think he already has an idea Iâm up
to something.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âMaybe it would be better if he did forbid your
nosing about, Kitty,â said Brad unexpectedly. âNo
sense in your taking chances of coming out here
to the marshes alone as you did yesterday.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, I wonât do that again,â she promised.
âNow that I know thereâs real danger. But to be
perfectly frank with you, Brad, I have an awful
feeling that somehow Dadâs good name may be at
stake in the dirty business thatâs going on.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâre not alone in wondering about that.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou know Hazel Dawson let it slip out the
other day that Dad asked for this appointment, and
she practically admitted that she asked to be sent
here, too. I know now that Dad and Hazel are old
friends, and are pulling together with one purpose.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âTo clear Chief Pharmacistâs Mate Dawson.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âExactly,â said Kitty. âAnd if the same complications
still exist my own dear dad may get in
bad.â</p>

<p class='c011'>They were too near the others now for further
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>discussion. As they joined the older couple Mr.
Carter said, âYou must have taken a long walk.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe really did,â Kitty told him.</p>

<p class='c011'>âBilly has been telling us about his tree climbing.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe almost scared the life out of me,â Kitty reported.
âDad, youâll really have to scold him again
about this tree climbing.â However, she wanted
to change the subject as quickly as possible and
said, âLetâs eat! Iâm starved.â</p>

<p class='c011'>She had brought a luncheon cloth which they
spread on the clean pine needles. Brad poured the
iced tea from their thermos jug while she set out
the sandwiches, cold ham, rolls, pickles and cookies.
Food had never tasted quite so good to Kitty. As
they ate, the pines made soft music in the gentle
breeze, while the lowering sun painted long shadows
on the woodland carpet. It seemed hard to
believe that any evil deed could be done in so
beautiful a spot, and that beyond these peaceful
tide-washed shores a world was in chaos because
of such intrigue everywhere.</p>

  <h2 id='true' class='c002'><span class='large'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</span><br />Â <br /><span class='large'>A DREAM COMES TRUE</span></h2>

<p class='c010'>On Monday morning Mrs. Evans called Kitty to
know if she could go over to Bayport, as they were
short of workers for special Canteen duty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSure. Iâll be delighted,â she said promptly.
âWhat time shall I report?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âEleven oâclock.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll be on the spot. Iâm scheduled for dish-washing
down at the Snack Bar tonight. Do you
think I should be back from Bayport in time for
that?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, sure. It wonât take long for the job over
there.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Not until Kitty put down the phone did she
remember that it was Monday, her busiest day at
home. While Jane did the weekly washing she always
looked after the lunch and household work.
Instantly she decided to switch days on the housework,
for she had made up her mind never to refuse
a Canteen call if she could possibly serve. So
at ten minutes of eleven she walked into the Bayport
Canteen. She found that Vera Parsons had
already come over from the island.</p>

<p class='c011'>âAh, on the dot,â said Miss Pearson. âItâs grand
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>to have a few girls we can depend on to put aside
personal interests for short-order calls.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhatâs cooking?â Kitty wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c011'>âTroop train coming through in half an hour,
though weâre never quite sure of the time,â explained
Miss Pearson. âThe boys will appreciate
some sandwiches and smokes and a little talk
with you girls.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty had met troop trains only a couple of
times, but she loved it. The boys were always so
full of fun and so appreciative of any little attention.
They didnât have many troop trains through
as Bayport was not on a main line. It was really
only a small coast town that had spread out like a
mushroom since war began. The small railroad
station hadnât had time to catch up with the amazing
growth of the rest of the place. The trains
rolled along open tracks beside an inadequate ticket
office and waiting rooms.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the girls packed into the station wagon to
drive over to the station, Kitty found herself sitting
beside Mrs. Janice, who had lived in the oyster
cannery district before the fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHope you found another house,â Kitty remarked
to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIndeed I have, honey, in a better section of
town, too.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm so glad. Iâm sure the new houses they
build around the cannery will be much better than
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>the old ones.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThey ainât making no plans to rebuild the cannery
till after the warâs over. But my boy, Jim,
got a job in the Bayshore Bakery. Weâre living
near there.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, Bayshore Bakery,â repeated Kitty without
realizing that there was a sort of question mark in
her tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYeah, I know all them rumors âbout the bakeryâjust
because they found some of their bread
wrappers on that captured sub. And how could
the bakery help that, I ask you?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo fault of theirs,â put in Beth Gilcrist, one
of the town girls. âWhen they sell bread they canât
be responsible for where it goes.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOf course not. My Jim thinks theyâre fine people
at the bakery, fair and square and considerate
of their employees. I canât see where itâs any fault
of theirs that the Germans were eating their bread.
Thereâs a thousand ways they could have got it.â</p>

<p class='c011'>As they rode toward the station Kitty didnât
doubt that she was right. There were a thousand
ways the Germans might have got that bread,
while she and Brad had been optimistic enough
to hope they could discover the one way it had
been done.</p>

<p class='c011'>The girls were scarcely out of the station wagon
with their sandwich trays slung over their shoulders,
when they saw the smoke of the troop train
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>far down the track. As if by magic people suddenly
appeared from all directions to see the troops go
through.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Canteen workers had to do considerable
elbowing to keep close enough to the track to
serve the men. They tried to spread out so their
wares would be available to all the coaches. However
Kit and Beth found themselves side by side
as they tried to keep the curious crowd from pushing
them onto the track.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly Beth leaned close and whispered to
Kitty, âLook to your left in a momentâthat manâs
been down here to see almost every troop train
since Iâve been in Canteen work.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty glanced at the hard-featured man whom
Beth indicated. In his broad-brimmed hat and
knee boots he looked like a western cowhand, while
his face was like some granite rock rising out of
the mesa. Then in the push she lost sight of him.
She and Beth separated as the train pulled into
the station.</p>

<p class='c011'>The boys already had their windows up, and
were leaning out, waving at the crowd, calling
greetings to the Canteen girls. Many of them had
letters they wanted mailed. Eager hands reached
down for the sandwiches and candy bars Kitty
offered. They were not supposed to ask where the
boys were going, but there was no law against asking
where they had been. Kitty put that question
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>to a sun-tanned chap, who thanked her so profusely
for the sandwich and cigarettes.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSouth Pacific,â he replied. âCarolinaâs home. It
sure looks good to me.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWish you happy landing for a long furlough,â
she said with a smile as she moved on down the
line.</p>

<p class='c011'>Several handed her letters, which she put on the
tray where the sandwiches had been. Suddenly
through the din she heard someone call out, âAnybody
round here ever heard of Terrapin Island?â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty glanced in amazement toward the end of
the coach to see a sunburned soldier looking over
the crowd as he asked the question.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSure!â one man said. Another replied, âAbout
twenty miles down the coast.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Most of them were low country people who
were familiar with the name of Terrapin Island,
even though few had been there.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty pushed her way closer to the window from
which the questioner leaned.</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnybody know old Uncle Mose, a colored man
whoâs been living there all his life?â the soldier
asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty could scarcely credit her hearing when he
asked that. Was it possible he was the Tradd boy
just returned from the Pacific? She was right under
his window now. As she thrust her last sandwich
into his hand she asked, âAre youâare you
Charles Whitlaw Tradd?â</p>

<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c000' />

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>The young man reached down and seized her
hand eagerly. âNot Whit himself,â he said eagerly,
âbut his best buddy.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, this is a break!â exclaimed Kitty. âI never
dreamed Iâd find someone so soon who knows Mr.
Tradd.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThen you do know Whit and Uncle Mose and
Terrapin Island?â The soldier spoke hurriedly,
fearing the train might pull out at any moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>âUncle Mose and Terrapin Island, but not your
Whit,â Kitty replied. âWhereâs heâWhit?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âStill in the South Pacific. Iâd be there, too,
but for a cracked ankle,â he added ruefully.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kittyâs face showed her disappointment.</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut he told me if I ever got to Carolina I was
to try to find out how Uncle Mose is faring.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHeâs fine. I saw him yesterday. But heâs awful
lonesome and wants to hear from Whit.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSay, this is a bit of luck!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âGive me Whitâs address.â ordered Kitty. âI
promised Uncle Mose Iâd write a letter for him and
send it to his young âMassaâ if I could get the address.
Imagine meeting you!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd imagine meeting you!â The young man
took out a card and scribbled an address rapidly
on it. As he handed it down to Kitty he also gave
her a dollar. âTake that and buy the old man
some âbaccyâ for his pipe. Tell him itâs from
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>Whit.â</p>

<p class='c011'>The train was beginning to move now, and
Kitty trotted along beside it, handing up the last
bar of chocolate from her tray. âWhatâs your
name?â she called.</p>

<p class='c011'>âKenneth Turner. My name and address are on
back of the card, too. Write and let me know what
Uncle Mose says. Say, whatâs your name?â he yelled
as an after-thought, when it was almost too late.</p>

<p class='c011'>âKitty Carter,â she laughingly called back.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then with a final wave he was gone as he drew
his head inside the window, leaving Kitty rather
dazed as she looked at the card and the dollar in
her hand. These were positive proof that the thing
had really happened.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the way back to the Canteen Kitty told the
other workers of her experience. âYou could never
believe such a thing as that would happen. Why, it
was only yesterday that I met Uncle Mose for the
first time, when we ate our supper over on Terrapin
Island. Itâs really a small world after all.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYeah, real small,â said Vera sourly, âwhere
everybody knows everybodyâs business.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty looked at her friend, feeling somewhat
taken aback, but she didnât ask what she meant
until they were on their way back to Palmetto
Island on the bus.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou seemed to forget that people all around
you heard every word you and that chap said,â
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>Vera retorted in a rather severe tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWell, there was nothing secret about it.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âMaybe not. But there was one hard-boiled
listener, who definitely registered the fact that you
talked with Uncle Mose on Terrapin Island yesterday.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty felt the blood rising to her cheeks as she
realized that might be significant.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThat islandâs posted all over with âNo trespassingâ
signs,â Vera stated. âAnd the owner was
standing right there staring at you, and listening
to everything you said.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNot Mr. Beeson?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOf course.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhich was he?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThe tall hard-faced man in the Stetson and
knee boots.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThat man? Why Beth Gilcrist pointed him out
to me and told me he meets all the troop trains.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAs soon as that fellow yelled out about Terrapin
Island I started over to talk to him, and I saw
Beeson headed that way, too. Then after you took
the floor he didnât open his trap. Just stood there
glaring at you as if he could kill you with a look.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, how awful!â But Kitty couldnât tell Vera
just how awful it was.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the middle of the afternoon when she
reached home to find Jane starting out to take
Billy for a walk.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>âYoâ Pah phoned and said he would eat up to
de horsepital tonightâgot some extra work to do,â
explained Jane.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThen weâll have a light supper early. I have
to be at the Canteen at seven oâclock.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Billy kept tugging at Janeâs hand, saying crossly,
âCome on. I wanner go to walk.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBilly, stop nagging Jane till we get through
talking,â chided Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe been like dat all day, Miss Kit, pesterinâ me
âbout first one tâing anâ den annuder.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âMaybe he needs a little outing. You two run
along and Iâll see about supper.â</p>

<p class='c011'>For the first time Kitty was a little late reaching
the Canteen, but this had been a day when she
found it difficult to keep up with all her obligations.
It was her night for dish-washing duty. She
had little to do until the dirty dishes began to pile
up, so she strolled around the hall, talking to the
service men. Suddenly she noticed Hazel Dawson
at the chessboard, and to her amazement saw that
Chief Krome sat opposite. She strolled over and
put her hand caressingly on Hazelâs shoulder.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHow are you progressing?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSlow going, I fear. I never tried to learn such
a complicated game.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSheâs doing fineâreally she is,â stated Krome.
He glanced up and recognized Kitty. âOh, itâs you?
Did the boys enjoy that shrimp creole the other
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>night?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSure did, thanks to the recipe.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Someone was playing a Brahms Waltz on the
piano and Kitty hummed it softly.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSing it, Kitty dear. Those were lovely words
set to the music that you sang for me the other
night,â Hazel said, glancing up from her board.</p>

<p class='c011'>âDo please, Kitty,â urged Jimmy Barnes, who
stood near. âYouâve been promising to sing for us
a long time.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âCome ahead,â said Brad, catching her hand and
leading her toward the piano.</p>

<p class='c011'>âAll right, if you insist,â said Kitty graciously.</p>

<p class='c011'>No sooner had her rich mezzo-soprano voice
swelled with the piano accompaniment than the
entire hall fell silent. Everyone turned toward her
to look and listen entranced. For a moment after
the last notes faded softly there was a breathless
hush, then a storm of applause.</p>

<p class='c011'>âMore,â someone called out.</p>

<p class='c011'>âGive us another,â a marine demanded.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty leaned over and whispered to Sergeant
Bradshaw at the piano. Laughing, he began the
Australian folk song that was such a rage, <i>Waltzing
Matilda</i>. Kitty sang the first verse, glancing
around the room with her flashing smile as the
words raced from her lips. Then at the chorus she
lifted her hands with an impelling movement and
said, âEverybody sing.â Instantly the room rocked
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>with nonsense and rhythm.</p>

<p class='c011'>After the storm subsided Kitty sang <i>Tipperary</i>.
While they clapped at the conclusion she ran off
to the Canteen kitchen. Ned Miller was sent in
to drag her out. She thrust her head through the
doorway to call, âItâs my night to wash dishes.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWeâll wash the dishes,â came a chorus in retort.</p>

<p class='c011'>âAgainst the rules. Iâll sing another night.â</p>

<p class='c011'>She was flushed and buoyantly happy when she
closed the door and turned back toward the sink.</p>

<p class='c011'>âGosh, you oughtnât to be washing dishes!â exclaimed
Sally. âAnybody with a voice like that!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âFiddlesticks!â exclaimed Kitty. âTheyâre badly
in need of dish washers, and they obviously donât
need singers.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDonât they?â burst forth Judy. âWhy Kitty,
they ought to send you overseas to sing to the
boys behind the fighting lines.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDonât make fun of me, Judy.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Judy had really voiced a wish that lay in the
deepest recesses of Kittyâs heart. To such a career
as that her daydreaming had constantly taken her
since war began. But its fulfillment seemed beyond
her wildest dreams. The practical side of her nature
had tried to still those high ambitions as she
planned to go first into the WAVES, and later into
Canteen work.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou have a way with the boys that makes them
laugh and cry, cheer and clap,â continued Sally.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>âShe sure has. Thatâs the sort of entertainer
they ought to be thrilled to find,â added Judy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty didnât tell them that a thousand times in
her daydreaming she had visioned herself doing
what she had just done. It had given her the
greatest thrill she had ever known.</p>

<p class='c011'>When she finished the dishes she had a free interval
until another pile accumulated, so she went
outside to find Brad. She was eager to know what
he would think of her experience at the troop
train.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSay, Kit, theyâre all crazy about your singing,â
said Brad when she joined him.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThanks, Brad.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âCaptain Crawford heard you, and said you surely
ought to be with the entertainers.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, Brad, Iâm not half good enough for that!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOf course you are! Youâll be surprised at what
he went on to say.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Her eyes were shining as she waited expectantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSaid he was going to write a friend of hisâan
official talent scout. He said he must hear about
you.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI canât believe it!â</p>

<p class='c011'>As they talked they crossed the long hall, and
finally went out to their quiet corner in the court.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâve something to tell you,â Kitty said as they
sat down. Then quickly she gave him an account
of her experience at the troop train.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>âIâm not surprised,â Brad said. âIâve felt rather
sure Beeson must be the middleman in this business,
after what we picked up Sunday. That tough
old customer will be on the alert for you, if you
ever go to the island again.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI certainly intend to go.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNot without me. Iâve been wanting to go
back again for another look around.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâve got to carry Uncle Mose his dollarâs worth
of smoking tobacco, and write that letter for him.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âMeeting that fellow from the Pacific does sort
of put you under obligations.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âGuess Iâd better get back to my dishes,â said
Kitty, rising. âJudy will be calling me a shirker if
I donât. She doesnât enjoy this dish-washing part
of the job any more than I do.â</p>

<p class='c011'>A few minutes later she was wielding the dish
mop when Mrs. Evans came in to say, âKitty,
someone wants you on the phone.â</p>

<p class='c011'>She hurriedly crossed the hall to the near-by
office, wondering if it was her father. She received
quite a shock when she heard Janeâs voice:
âMiss Kit, reckon you bettah come home.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy? Whatâs wrong, Jane?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âItâs Billy. Reckon he sick. He skin feel hot
as fire to mah hanâ, and he cough like he gwine
choke to deaf.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll be right home!â stated Kitty, and put down
the phone with a bang.</p>

<p class='c010'>Kitty almost ran into Brad as she came from
the telephone.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhatâs wrong, Kit?â he asked, seeing the misery
in her face.</p>

<p class='c011'>âBillyâs sick. I must go home at once.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll borrow Bud Wilsonâs car and take you,â
he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThanks. That will help lots. I have to tell
Mrs. Evans Iâm going, and get my coat.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Brad was waiting near the kitchen door when
she came out, his friendâs car keys dangling on his
finger.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI really shouldnât have left him tonight,â Kitty
said contritely as she jumped into the car. âJane
told me he was cross all day. Heâs always cross
before he gets sick.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Brad wasted no time in driving the five blocks
to the house. He went in with Kitty to see if
there was anything he could do. Jane had heard
them coming and was already at the door to let
them in when they crossed the porch.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHow is he?â asked Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âReckon he mighty sick, Miss Kit.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>Kitty hurried past her into Billyâs little room.
He lay on the bed, his round cheeks red, his
mouth open as he struggled for breath. In a moment
she was sitting on the bed, bending over him.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhere do you feel bad, darling?â</p>

<p class='c011'>His little hand went to his throat. Terrified she
thought of diphtheria. âWhy didnât you tell me
you felt bad before I went off?â she chided.</p>

<p class='c011'>He only moaned and tossed his head restlessly.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI done call yoâ Pah, honey. Heâs cominâ right
home,â said Jane.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThanks, Jane. Itâs nice to have someone so
dependable.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll take a look at that throat,â said Brad, âas
soon as I wash my hands.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âGet him a fresh towel, Jane.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty turned the bedside lamp on the flushed
little face when Brad came back. She had already
sent for a spoon to hold his tongue down.
After one glance inside that swollen throat Brad
said, âUm, badly inflamed. Weâve got to do something
about this.â</p>

<p class='c011'>He and Kitty exchanged anxious glances. They
heard steps running up the porch, and a moment
later Mr. Carter was with them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty, met him at the door to whisper, âHis
throat. Oh, Dad, Iâm so afraid of diphtheria!â</p>

<p class='c011'>Before going near the boy Mr. Carter went to
the bathroom to wash up. After a careful inspection
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>of the throat he drew Kitty aside.</p>

<p class='c011'>âDo you think it is?â she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>âCanât tell. Iâm going to take him straight up to
the hospital. Weâll soon know there. You get out
the car while I bundle him up.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll drive you over,â offered Brad. âI have
Bud Wilsonâs car out there.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty wrapped Billy in a warm blanket so that
only his nose was exposed. They closed all the car
windows, and Kitty sat in the back while her father
held the child on the front seat beside Brad.</p>

<p class='c011'>She wondered contritely why this had to happen
when she had left her brother practically all
day. Maybe if she had been home she would have
noticed that he was ill earlier.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Carter was allowed to stay in the room with
Billy while Dr. Fletcher examined him. In the
meantime Brad paced the hall with Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll never forgive myself for leaving him so
much today, if thereâs anything I could have done
to prevent this,â Kitty said accusingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs silly, Kit! No sense in blaming yourself.
You know how kids are. They almost always
come down sudden like that.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDo they?â She glanced hopefully at him through
tear-dimmed eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOf course. I can remember how I used to play
till I dropped, and in an hour or so would be
burning with fever.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>âBut suppose itâs diphtheria? They can die in
a few hours of that.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNot in these times with all the new treatment.
That knocks things out in no time.â</p>

<p class='c011'>They were at the farther end of the hall when
Kitty saw Hazel Dawson go into the room. âOh,
I hope theyâll let Hazel nurse him,â she said.
âThen Iâll be sure everythingâs being done for
him that possibly can be done.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThey probably will.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHow long will it take for them to find out
what it is?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNot long. Chief Carter will see to that.â</p>

<p class='c011'>At that very moment a white-uniformed interne
came out of the room, followed by Mr. Carter.
They hurried off toward the laboratory. The door
stood slightly ajar when Kitty and Brad came nearer.
Kitty saw Hazel inside and motioned to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>âMay I come in now?â she whispered.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHeâs already sleeping. Perhaps youâd better not
till we find out what it is.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWill it take long?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo, not with your father around to see that
everything is speeded up.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAre you going to nurse him?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes, Iâm glad to say. Your father asked for me.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm so thankful! Now Iâll know he has the
best of care. Oh Hazel, Iâll never forgive myself
ifâif anythingââ</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>Kitty couldnât go on, and Hazel put an arm
around her waist. Then she turned to Brad to say,
âI think youâd better take her home. Weâll see to
everything here.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI couldnât possibly go till I know what it is.
Nobody can understand how I feel. I was away
from him practically all day. Maybe if Iâd put
him to bed myself I would have touched him and
found he had a fever.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDonât be absurd, Kitty,â said Hazel almost severely.
âYou couldnât have prevented his picking
up some germ. Stop blaming yourself for what
canât be helped.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI know. Youâre only trying to make me feel
better about it,â said Kitty, wiping her tears with
a large handkerchief which Brad had thrust into
her hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs right. Dry your tears. You know men
donât like to see a woman cry,â Hazel reminded
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty smiled. âBradâs been awful goodâhelping
us out.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âKeep it up a little longer, young man,â Hazel
directed. âYou and Kitty can wait in the sun parlor
until they bring back the report. Then Iâll get
Mr. Carter to look you up and let you know what
the trouble is.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty was glad to obey these instructions. Brad
found some pictorial magazines and they sat on
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>the couch, turning the pages, for there seemed
nothing they could say while they waited. Kitty
saw little of what was on those printed pages. Her
ears were too alert for a familiar step in the hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHow easy it is to take all the good things of
life for granted until something like this comes
along,â she thought. Ambition had been eternally
prodding her to conquer new worlds, when within
the four walls of her own home there should have
been happiness enough to fill their three hearts
to overflowing. She tried to tell Brad something
of what she was thinking.</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut your desire to help in Canteen work, or
any war work, is no reason why you should blame
yourself for neglecting Billy,â Brad said as he
tried to make her see straight.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI knowâof course not.â She brushed her hand
across her eyes and back over her forehead.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs something weâve all got to doâevery
man and woman in the countryâor there wonât
be any homes left for us to be happy in.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâre so sensible. Itâs such a comfort to have
someone to talk toâjust to sit here with me!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âGosh! I havenât done anything!â</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then Kitty heard the long-expected footsteps
in the hall and jumped up. Fortunately they
had the sun parlor to themselves. All other visitors
had long since gone home. Her fatherâs face told
her at once that the situation was better than they
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>feared.</p>

<p class='c011'>âA strep infection,â he said in answer to her
eager question. âWeâll soon knock that out with
the sulfa drug.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhat a relief! I think I would have died had
it been anything worse.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs bad enough if not caught in time,â her
father stated.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHow in the world do you suppose he got it?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThereâs been a lot of it here at the hospital.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut I never bring Billy to the hospital.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe could have picked it up almost anywhere.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Then with an appalling recollection Kitty saw
herself and Billy in their boat going past that hospital
dump in the marshes. That was where he
had got the germ, she was positive. Subconsciously
she had known it from the very beginning. Thatâs
why she had felt so stunned by Billyâs sickness.
Now that she honestly faced the results of her own
carelessness, she felt she couldnât endure it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Noting her pale face and the misery in her eyes,
Mr. Carter said, âBrad, please take her home for
me.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI couldnât leave till I know Billyâs going to be
all right, Dad.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou can do absolutely nothing here, Kitty,â
her father said almost severely. âHeâs in most competent
hands. Hazelâs going to nurse him, and I
plan to stay on for the night. I have my own
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>room I can use any time. Iâll see that everything
possible is done. It will be a relief to me to know
youâre home in bed.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty felt she could never sleep again, but said
in a resigned tone, âAll right, Dad. Iâll go.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Seeing her so crushed he put his arm around
her shoulder and went with her down the hall.
âGo home and take a hot bath to calm your nerves,
and get right into bed. Iâll phone you at six in
the morning.â</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>That night as Kitty tossed about, sleepless for
several hours, she made up her mind that if Billy
recovered she would tell her father everything that
had happened these last weeks to stir her suspicions.
She blamed herself for her pride and conceit
in hoping she, alone, could find an answer to those
problems that were continually stumping the FBI.</p>

<p class='c011'>She thought bitterly of what her psychology
teacher had once said, âWeâre very complicated
creatures, and how we sometimes hate to face the
truth.â And another time he had talked to their
class about how human beings compensate for
losses and disappointments. Yes, that was exactly
what she was trying to do in making herself a private
secret-service agent. She imagined she could
do something big enough in uncovering some dastardly
plot against her country. This would compensate
for her not being able to do more to help
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>the war effort. The fact that Billy had been her
stumbling block all along, even though she adored
him, made her feel all the more miserable now that
his safety was involved.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was late when her tired body and tortured
mind succumbed to weariness and she slept. She
slept so heavily then she didnât even rouse for the
anticipated phone call at six oâclock. Jane was in
the room when she opened her eyes, then sat up
suddenly, ashamed that she had overslept.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHas Dad phoned?â</p>

<p class='c011'>Janeâs kindly face told her that he had and that
the news was good. âYasâm, sho did. Billyâs bettah,
anâ yoâ Pah say you kin come see him.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty scarcely had patience to eat her breakfast,
which Jane insisted she must have before she left.
Even with that delay she was at the hospital in an
hour after waking. It was good to see her father
smiling a welcome from the foot of the bed, and
to see Billy drinking some milk through a tube,
while the day nurse held a glass near his pillow.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh darling, you do look better,â she said
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm all right, Kit. I like it at the hospital.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âKitâs going to stay with you while Daddy gets
some sleep.â She turned to her father and added,
âYou must go home and sleep some, Dad.â His
hollow eyes betrayed the fact that he had been up
all night.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>âIâve had breakfast, but bed will be very welcome.
If Billyâs very good today maybe weâll take
him home tomorrow. That new bike will be waiting
if he takes his medicine well and gets strong
in a hurry.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll be a good boy, Dad,â Billy promised.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty spent the day at the hospital, and didnât
go home until Hazel came in on night duty. Her
father had gone to his office in the early afternoon,
but he, also, was ready to go home as Kitty
left. She was very tired, but so relieved that Billy
was getting well that nothing else mattered.</p>

<p class='c011'>As they walked home in the twilight she could
still feel her fatherâs depression. When they had
gone a block in silence she slipped her hand
through his arm and asked, âWhatâs wrong, Dad?
Billyâs going to be all right, isnât he?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh yes. Yes indeed! His throat has cleared up
remarkably fast.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut youâre still worried about something.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm afraid I am, Kitten. Itâs not a new worry
by any means. Things are rather messed up at the
hospital in connection with my work.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhat do you mean, Dad? Iâve felt for a long
time that something was wrong.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI havenât wanted to worry you, but if you must
know thereâs a shortage somewhereâa leak that I
canât locate.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh!â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>âThe inspectorâs coming next week.â Her fatherâs
tone was bitter. âI wouldnât want to follow
Dawson to Santiago, or somewhere else equally as
remote.â</p>

  <h2 id='confession' class='c002'><span class='large'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</span><br />Â <br /><span class='large'>A CONFESSION</span></h2>

<p class='c010'>Kitty waited until her father had eaten dinner
before bringing up the subject that had weighed
on her mind since the previous evening. She knew
she would have no peace until she had made a
clean breast of the whole thing. When her father
was in his big chair in the living room she sank
on the couch near by.</p>

<p class='c011'>âDad, how long does it take a germâlike a strep
germâto develop after a person gets infected?â she
asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>âTwo or three days, sometimes sooner. We still
have a lot to learn about such things.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThen itâs all my fault that Billyâs ill.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYour fault?â Mr. Carter dropped the paper he
had just picked up.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI thoughtlessly took him where thereâre plenty
of germs. IâI was so intent on something I wanted
to find out, I didnât even think of the danger.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhat are you talking about, Kitty? Itâs absurd
blaming yourself for his illness. Youâve taken excellent
care of him ever since you came from school.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut, Dad, we went out into the marshes where
they dump the hospital waste.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>âYouâwhat?â Her father stared at her, shocked.
Then she could see by his expression that he was
recalling their conversation about the disposal of
the hospital waste.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs why I asked you where they dumped it.
I went there Saturday afternoon.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou and Billy alone?â</p>

<p class='c011'>She nodded. âBut I had a good reason for wanting
to go, Dad, a very good reason.â</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked puzzled, but his tone was not unkind
when he said, âI canât imagine any reason that
would take a sensitive girl like you out to a dump
pile.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI know you think Iâm crazy. But itâs a long
story and Iâll have to start at the beginning.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWell, sit back calmly and stop twisting that
pillow.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty tossed the pillow to the other end of the
couch and burst into tears. âOh Dad, Iâve been so
miserable for the last twenty-four hours I could
die. Itâs all because Iâm too proud. I wanted to do
something big for my countryâsomething spectacular.
Iâve let it make me indifferent to everything
else.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâre doing what you can, Kitten, in your
Canteen work.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes, I love that, but I wanted to do even more.
I thought I could uncover the work of some saboteurs.
IâI tried even to keep it all from you, to
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>do it all myself, that is Brad and I.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âKitty, calm yourself,â her father said almost
severely. âYouâre being very incoherent. Tell me
what all this is about.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI hardly know where to start to make you understand
why Iâve been so secret about it.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThe place to start is at the beginning. I suppose
all this has happened since you came home
from college.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes, of course. In fact the very day I decided
to go into Canteen work.â Then she told him of
her experience in the launch when she had introduced
Hazel and Lieutenant Cary. âThat was the
first hint I had that something was wrong somewhere.
Brad was with me, and in on it from the
very beginning.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSo youâve been suspicious of Lieutenant Cary
since then. Has anything else occurred to justify
such suspicions?â asked Mr. Carter, viewing his
daughterâs confession more seriously now.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, lots of thingsâthat is with people also
closely associated with him.â Then she told about
Punaro and her belief that he was connected with
the cannery fire, and later their coming unexpectedly
upon him at the dock. âIt looked to both
Brad and me that he was hiding a tightly nailed
box with the rubbish on the barge.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âUm-m,â grunted her father significantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>âDad, thatâs why I wanted to go out to the dump
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>pile and see what the situation was for myself.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father had risen and was now pacing the
floor. He turned toward her sharply and said,
âSurely you didnât go ashore there?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, no, we only rode by it.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThen Billy didnât get the germ from that
dumpâor there was no greater chance of his getting
it there than anywhere else. But the foolish
thing, Kitty, was you two going alone. You might
have taken Brad with you as long as you had
discussed these things with him.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe was down at the beach for the afternoon.
I picked up more clues down there, too, which
made it seem certain supplies are going out from
our hospital to the German subs. One of the Coast
Guard men told about them finding Bayshore
Bakery bread on one of those captured subs.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIf that was all theyâre getting I might not have
so much to worry about,â said her father.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty glanced at him sharply. âWhat do you
mean, Dad? You think theyâre getting more than
that?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo doubt they are.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty knew he was keeping something from her.
However, she was determined now to tell him all.
âAnother strange thing happened yesterday that
may or may not be significant.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes. What was that?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIt was odd, after seeing old Uncle Mose on
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>Terrapin Island Sunday, someone on the troop
train yesterday asked me about him.â Kitty gave a
sprightly account of the veteran returned from the
Pacific. âAnd by the way I have that dollar and
must take some tobacco to the old man.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd what connection does all this have with
the clues youâre running down?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âVera Parsons told me that the owner of Terrapin
Island was near when I was talking to that
fellow. She said he actually glared at me when he
heard Iâd been on the island. Of course it was all
posted over with âNo trespassingâ signs, and maybe
we shouldnât have eaten our supper there.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe did no harm. Those signs generally apply
to hunting, fishing and fire-making.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut Dad, Brad and I are wondering if this
Beeson isnât in on the dirty work.â</p>

<p class='c011'>He paused in front of her, his face showing alert
interest. âHow do you figure that out?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âUncle Mose told us Beeson comes here to the
hospital for food scraps for his hogs. Brad and I
figure thereâs obliged to be a middleman to make
the contact between the hospital and the spies from
the subs.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Chief Carterâs face was eager as he said, âKitty,
you may have picked up a missing link!â</p>

<p class='c011'>She jumped to her feet now, and stood facing
her father. âDad, youâve been keeping something
from me, too!â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>âIâll have to admit I have, Kitten. You had
enough on your young shoulders without being
burdened with my problems.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly apprehension pierced her heart. It was
one thing to work for the sheer thrill of trapping
spies, but quite another to find her father was
really involved.</p>

<p class='c011'>âDad, what is it?â she asked. âDoes all this in
any way affect you? A while back I thought it
might and thenââ</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm afraid it does, Kitty. But go on, I want
to hear your reasons for believing Beeson is
involved.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âFor one thing he leased that island after we
went into the war. That certainly could have been
done with an ulterior motive. Second, he moved
Uncle Mose out of his cabin up to the other end
of the island. Uncle Mose used to live in sight of
the hospital dump pile. Also he has a look-out in
the pine thicket.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âA look-out?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBrad climbed the pine after we got Billy down
Sunday. Itâs wired to make climbing easy. Thereâs
a seat at the top with a marvelous view of the entire
marshes and out to sea.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut you didnât mention all this Sunday.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe thought right away it was connected with
the whole dirty business. Hazel was along, so we
decided to say nothing until we could figure things
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>out better.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIs that all?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe figured that a small radio could be carried
up on Beesonâs back, so he could direct action from
his look-out. He could watch people coming from
any direction, and warn small boats coming in
from the subs. Seemed like a perfect set-up.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father looked at her a moment and a slow
smile spread over his face, in spite of the anxiety
still in his eyes. âKitten, you show remarkable talent
for becoming a first-class detective.â</p>

<p class='c011'>She pursed her lips. âToo nerve-racking, Dad.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIs that all youâve picked up about Beeson?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBeth Gilcrist, a Canteen worker over in Bayport,
who meets all the troop trains, told me Beeson
meets most of them, too.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHm-m, so he does, eh? He seems to have no
scarcity of gas for these trips back and forth.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Carter sat down on the couch, and stared
into space, as he thought over what she had told
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd another thing. Brad found out from the
man who looks after the incinerator that repair
parts have come for it twice, and were not what
he ordered.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHm-m, looks like somebody at the factory may
be cooperating in keeping it out of order,â Mr.
Carter surmised.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs exactly what Brad and I figured out.
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>Thatâs why we feel so certain the barge goes into
the marshes for more reasons than to haul off
garbage.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Carter made no reply to this but just sat
staring ahead of him. Kitty recalled what he had
said as they were coming home that evening. The
inspector was coming down and there was a shortage
in his department. She had thought when he
mentioned it that he meant a financial shortage.
Now an appalling possibility entered her mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>âDad, could your shortage have anything to do
with all this?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDefinitely it could, Kitty. The amazing things
you have just told me may help me clear up a
very embarrassing situation.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty recalled that he had said once that there
were some things he couldnât talk about even to
his own daughter, but she now ventured to ask,
âCanât you tell me about it now, Dad?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm going to,â he retorted in a tone that implied
his desperation. âBut this is for you alone,
Kitty. Not even Brad is to know.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Her eyes widened. âBut you think he is trustworthy,
donât you?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOf courseâabsolutely! Nevertheless this is to
go no further.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âCertainly. If thatâs the way you want it.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAs you have probably guessed Willard Dawson
lost out here for the very shortage I am now
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>facing.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut Iâm sure he was not to blame either. Who
could look at his fine face and believe him capable
ofâof anything dishonest? He simply couldnât be
a traitor any more than you, Dad!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOf course we feel certain of that. Thatâs why
I asked to be sent here. Iâve been in hopes of
clearing up the situation.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHazel came here for the same reason, didnât
she?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes, she did. But so farâthat is until you told
me all this tonight Iâve run into nothing but
snags.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âJust what did you mean when you said there
was a shortage?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAll medical supplies must pass through my
hands. I have to O.K. all orders. I have been
most careful in making those ordersâyet at the
end of each month the sum total of materials used
far exceeds the normal use of a hospital our size.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou mean medicines, bandages and things like
that, Dad?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAll expendable supplies used in the hospitalâmedical
supplies, of course.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThose are the kind of things theyâd be badly
in need of on a German sub?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes, of course.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDo you suppose those sneaks are getting some
of the stuff out of the hospital along with the
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>food?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIn fact, Kitty, the whole set-up may be for the
purpose of getting our medical supplies instead of
food. Almost anyone can get hold of food to let
the enemy have, but the drug business is quite a
different thing.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty felt the gooseflesh prickle along her spine.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, Dad, suppose I hadnât paid any attention
to all those queer things!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDonât be too complacent about it all, Kitty.
We havenât caught the saboteurs yet, nor pinned
anything on anybody.â</p>

<p class='c010'>They brought Billy home from the hospital the
next day. Like most husky youngsters he was
soon playing around the house, and by the end of
the week seemed none the worse for his experience.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm afraid you have a somber rival in your
son,â Kitty said one evening to her father.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHowâs that?â asked Mr. Carter, forcing himself
out of his preoccupation.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe has quite a crush on Hazelâtalks of her
constantly.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father laughed in a self-conscious manner.
âOh, he has, eh?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe wants me to invite her to supper again and
let him sit up late.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Carter laughed. âYou must do that, Kitten.
But for Hazelâs watchful care Billy might not have
recovered so quickly.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm sure of that.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd by the way, my dear, Iâve talked with Hazel
about what you told me the other night.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, did you?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âShe told me about the chess playingâLieutenant
Cary hobnobbing with Krome, Punaro and
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>men from the galley.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhen I saw him playing with Punaro I thought
they must be two of a kind. I was already suspicious
of them both. But Krome seems a good-natured
sort. Somehow I hate to think he may be
in on the dirty work.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHazel doesnât think he isâquite the contrary.
And it wouldnât be very likely. A man whoâs been
in the service ten or twelve years.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDid Hazel tell you why sheâs been learning to
play chess? I was very curious but didnât dare ask.â</p>

<p class='c011'>To Kittyâs surprise her father laughed heartily.
âHazelâs keen, and certainly has done a grand job
as detective since sheâs been here, but I doubt if
sheâll make a go of the chess racket.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhat do you mean?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âShe has a theory that Lieutenant Cary engages
Krome in a chess game every time Punaro wants
to get away with something in the galley.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Something clicked in Kittyâs mind. âAnd thereâs
every reason to believe sheâs right!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHuh, so youâre backing her up in the far-fetched
idea!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNot far-fetched at all, and Iâll tell you why.
The other night when Brad and I ran into Punaro
down at the dock, we told him we were looking
for Chief Krome. Right away he said, âHeâs upstairs
in the recreation room, playing chess with
Dr. Cary.â Note he said Dr. Cary, not Lieutenant.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>There was a slightly quizzical expression on
Chief Carterâs face as he asked, âWell, is that significant?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âVery. A man who had known Cary before he
went into the service would call him doctor under
excitement, and Punaro was not only excited, but
furious at us.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âKitten, I become more certain every day that
you should give up your Canteen work and join
the FBI.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo, indeed! I have more pleasant ambitions
for service to my country,â she retorted.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSo Punaro knew just where his Chief was the
other night?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âJust like that!â said Kitty, snapping her fingers.
âIt certainly looks as though Hazelâs got the right
ideaâthat Lieutenant Cary keeps Krome occupied
while Punaro has a free hand below.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDoes sound plausible,â her father conceded.</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut you havenât told me Hazelâs idea in learning
to play chess herself.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, I think she hopes to engage Cary sometimes
in a chess game, when he would prefer to
have Krome as a partner.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty laughed. âShe thinks then that Krome may
go below and find Punaro at his dirty work.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âShe said if that could happen it would be worth
the discomfort of sitting opposite Cary for a game
of chess.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>On Friday evening over a cup of coffee and a
doughnut at the Snack Bar Kitty and Brad made
plans to go to Terrapin Island the following afternoon,
as Brad would have the afternoon off.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Kitty went to town Saturday morning she
spent the dollar the veteran had given her for
smoking tobacco, and bought a new pipe as her
own gift to Uncle Mose. This time she left Billy
in good hands, for her father was taking Hazel
into Bayport to a picture, and Billy was to go
with them. So Kitty started off with Brad in their
launch early in the afternoon with a free mind.
With patriotic zeal they put their hands to the
oars, instead of using the gasoline in the tank.</p>

<p class='c011'>âKit, Iâve been doing a little spying since we
last had a chance to talk,â Brad told her.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHope you picked up something valuable.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâve been watching the barge movements.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, yes. Iâve wondered if that could be done.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âPunaro takes the stuff off to the dump every
second morning. He uses a fast little motor boat
for towing, which ought to make the haul in
about an hour over to the dump and another hour
back.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIs that his schedule?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, no! He leaves at dawn and barely gets back
to the hospital in time for chow at noon. Last time
I had a day off I made it my business to watch his
movements.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>âDoes anybody go with him?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo. Itâs really a one-man job, which suits his
purpose very well. I figure Punaro has at least two
hours leeway to contact his accomplices.â</p>

<p class='c011'>They rowed past the hospital and soon turned
south through the marsh-bordered inlet. The water
was rather choppy and there were ragged, wind-swept
clouds overhead, but neither of them were
afraid of a little rain.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were almost in sight of the pines on Terrapin
Island when Kitty said, âThereâs probably
someone else upstairs in the hospital whoâs involved
in all thisâsomeone besides Cary and
Punaro.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhat makes you think that?â</p>

<p class='c011'>She had to be careful not to reveal anything her
father had told her. But she thought Brad might
be in a position to pick up information her father
couldnât get.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIf Punaro is actually supplying the subs with
fresh food, doesnât it seem possible they might take
other things, tooâmedical supplies, for instance?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâre right. I hadnât thought of that.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Bradâs pull on the oars quickened as his thoughts
raced ahead with this new idea.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSlow up!â exclaimed Kitty, when she was out
of breath trying to keep in rhythm. âThis is no
marathon, you know.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Brad suddenly drew in his oar and turned to
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>face her. She was glad enough to drift for a few
minutes and rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>âKitty, now that you mention that fact I recall
seeing Punaro talking several times with Petty
Officer Brinson.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBrinson?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOne of the ward attendants. I thought it was
only about clearing the trash from the wards. But
I bet Brinson could get away with plenty if he had
a mind to.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm glad you told me about him, Brad. I havenât
had a chance to tell you I talked to Dad about
all this.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou did?â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty nodded. âI was so unhappy about it all
when Billy got sick. I felt that somehow I was to
blame, so I just told Dad everything.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhat did he think?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âPlenty!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI mean what does he think we ought to do
with all this information weâve been picking up?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe didnât say. You know a man in his position
canât say much, even to his daughter.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs true, of course.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThe inspectorâs coming down soon, he said. I
have a feeling he plans to take it up with him.â
Kitty decided she had better change the subject,
for fear it might slip out that her father was dangerously
involved.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>The tide had carried them in closer to Terrapin
Island while they talked. As Kitty saw the beautiful
pine-clad bluff rising out of the surrounding green
marshes she said, âWouldnât that make a grand
place for a summer home?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll say. And if the old Hindu your father told
us about was right, those pines ought to have
enough vitality to make us immortal.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty laughed and picked up her oar. âWeâd
better go on and see Uncle Mose, or this stormâs
going to catch us before we get home.â</p>

<p class='c011'>They didnât stop at their former landing place,
but rowed on along the inlet flowing east of the
island. It was indeed a lonely spot. They now had
a good view of Mangrove Island beyond a mile
strip of marshy flats, which were interlaced with
tidewater creeks. A couple of cranes stood knee-deep
in water, but took flight at the sound of approaching
oars, their long legs trailing behind them
like streamers. A line of pelicans moved out toward
sea, their wings alternately flapping and poised,
as they followed the impulses of their leader.</p>

<p class='c011'>âDonât you love it here?â exclaimed Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll say. Itâs really Godâs country.â</p>

<p class='c011'>They passed the spot where they had found
Uncle Mose fishing, and saw his log cabin far
back among the trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhatâll we do if Beeson wonât let us see
Uncle Mose?â asked Kitty a little nervously. âThe
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>old negro told us his new house is right back of
Beesonâs place.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSurely he wouldnât be so rude as to prevent us
seeing the old darky.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou never can tell. Those âNo trespassingâ
signs may apply to callers also.â</p>

<p class='c011'>A half mile farther on they came in sight of
the Traddsâ old summer home. No doubt it had
once been a fine residence, but even from the
water they could see that its tabby walls were
crumbling, and the paint had long since worn off
the columned porch. Though the grounds were
neglected and weed-grown, old azaleas, in full
bloom, made gorgeous splashes of color. Wisteria
vines had been left to run riotously over several
pines, and the lavender blossoms were now hanging
far up the brown trunks.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSeems a shame for a man like Beeson to have
such a heavenly spot,â said Kitty, when they
shipped their oars, and Brad made the boat fast
to a rickety dock in front of the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tide had just begun to rise, so that their
boat was eight or ten feet below the level of the
dock. There was a ladder, however, by which they
could go up. Brad had just given Kitty a hand
to help her up when there came a furious baying
of hounds from the direction of the house. A moment
later they saw three vicious-looking dogs
making for the dock.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>âWe canât take a chance on them!â exclaimed
Brad, realizing at once that this was how Beeson
kept intruders away from his house.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty tumbled back into the boat, while Brad
released their line, so they could push off. He was
not a moment too soon, for the dogs dashed along
the dock and hung over the edge, their fierce jaws
dripping as they barked furiously.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhat a reception!â exclaimed Kitty. âIt really
looks as though Uncle Mose wonât get his smoking
tobacco today.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo launch tied up here. I suppose Beeson is
away, and this is the guard he has set.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWould an honest man be so careful that nobody
comes prowling around?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI doubt it.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSally and Lana Bright have lived in this low
country all their lives. They say the doors of their
country house are never locked.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThose who do the most skulduggery are likely
to be very suspicious of other people.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Their boat was carried off toward a shelving
beach by the current. Noting this the dogs left
their high perch on the dock and ran around to
head them off from landing anywhere else.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWell trained, arenât they?â Brad commented.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSure looks like it.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI suppose we can turn around and go home the
way we came,â Brad said ruefully.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>âI hate to be checkmated like this,â Kitty said
in disgust.</p>

<p class='c011'>She reached for her oar when suddenly Brad
exclaimed, âWait! There comes somebody.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty glanced in the direction he pointed. âWhy,
itâs Uncle Mose himself!â</p>

<p class='c011'>The old man came hobbling down the weed-grown
path. When he was in hearing distance Kitty
called out, âHi, Uncle Mose! Itâs your friends.
Call off the dogs.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Mose came to the waterâs edge and peered
at them with dimming eyes before he said, turning
to the dogs, âShut up, you hounds! Quit dat
racket! Donâ you know quality folks when you
sees âem?â</p>

<p class='c011'>He finally had to get a stick to send the hounds
slinking back toward the house. Brad pushed their
boat closer to the shelving shore where the old
man stood.</p>

<p class='c011'>âAfter that reception I guess weâd better stay
in the boat,â suggested Brad.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI have good news for you, Uncle Mose,â Kitty
said when they were close enough to speak without
yelling.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYassum. I sho be pleased to hear it.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI got young Traddâs address.â Then Kitty told
him of meeting Traddâs buddy on the troop train.
âHe gave me a dollar to buy you some tobacco so
I brought it along.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>She stood in the prow to offer the gift while
Uncle Mose waded a few feet into the water.</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd hereâs a pipe I brought you, too,â added
Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>The weathered old face crinkled into a smile. âI
sho proud oâ dis, Missie. Hit moighty thoughty oâ
you to come way out here to brung it to me.â He
crammed the gifts into his coat pockets.</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut I promised to write a letter for you, too.
If youâll tell me what you want me to say Iâll
write to Mr. Tradd.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, Missie, would you do dat fer sho?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOf course.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe ainât got much time, Missie. Mah boss due
back here pretty soon now. He done tole me I
ainât to pass no words wid yâall if you come back
here again.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty glanced uneasily north along the inlet, but
it was empty in the slanting sunlight that had
broken through ragged clouds.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSo he warned you, eh? He was down at the
station the day that boy gave me the money for
your tobacco.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSo dat how he know youâs gwine come again.
I donât hafter mind whut he say. I ainât he nigger.
Iâll be a Tradd nigger till I die, anâ I ainât gwine
set here anâ see him bring disgrace on dis island.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhat do you mean, Uncle Mose?â</p>

<p class='c011'>The old man came closer, almost knee deep in
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>water now. His gnarled brown hands gripped the
side of the boat as he said, âI ainât able to row no
boat crost to de mainland where us got ole frâenâs,
so I ainât hab no one to trusâ âbout whut gwine
on round here till yâall come.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThen Iâm very glad we came,â said Kitty encouragingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâs been libinâ on dis earth nigh on to a hunnert
year, anâ Iâse larn to know people you can
trusâ at fust sight. Yâall sho belongst to dat class.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThank you, Uncle Mose. Weâll try to live up
to your good opinion of us.â Kitty saw it was useless
to try to hurry him, though she was terrified
for fear Beeson would come and catch them here.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhat was it you want her to write?â asked
Brad, not quite so patient as Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSuh, I sees youâs a sailor anâ defender oâ our
country like mah young Massa. You wear de same
color uniform, too, anâ I knows youâs to be trusted.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI hope so, Uncle.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnâ you knows as well as I does dat it ainât
right fer no white man in dese times to be hobnobbinâ
wid furriners. Dis war weâs fightinâ is wid
furriners, ainât it?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIt sure is, Uncle Mose,â replied Brad. âBut
what white man is hobnobbing with foreigners?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âMr. Beeson. Dey comes here right often at
nightâanâ always goes away wid boxes anâ
bundles.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>Kitty and Brad exchanged startled glances.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHow do you know his callers are foreigners?â
asked Brad.</p>

<p class='c011'>âDey talks a langwidge I ainât never heard round
dese parts.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou were close enough to hear them talk?â
asked Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âMr. Beeson think Iâse sleepinâ. Mah sight
ainât so good no moâ, but mah hearinâ keen, anâ I
know when dem stranger come ashore.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou heard their motorboat, I suppose,â said
Brad.</p>

<p class='c011'>âNaw suh. Dey donâ come in no motorboat.
Nothinâ but ole bateau. Whilst dey was up to de
house one dark night I went down to de water
anâ seen it.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kittyâs cheeks were pale, her eyes apprehensive
when she met Bradâs troubled glance.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI hear Mr. Beeson talkinâ âbout buyinâ dis
island. You tell young Massa fer me, Missie, not
to sold it. Reckon Mr. Beeson bootlegginâ or somepen.
He gwine bring disgrace on dis place.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty didnât take time to tell him that the bootlegging
of other days was mild to what she now
knew Mr. Beeson was doing. But suddenly she
lifted her head in alarm. She had caught the
sound of a distant motorboat.</p>

<p class='c011'>âReckon dat him now! Yâall bettah lefâ out oâ
here right now,â warned Uncle Mose.</p>

  <h2 id='escape' class='c002'><span class='large'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</span><br />Â <br /><span class='large'>A NARROW ESCAPE</span></h2>

<p class='c010'>âYou got time to cross yonder anâ hide in de
marsh,â Uncle Mose told Kitty and Brad when they
heard the sound of the approaching motorboat.</p>

<p class='c011'>âLetâs get going,â said Kitty, picking up her oar.
âYouâd better hide your tobacco and new pipe,
Uncle Mose.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYasâm, sho will.â The old manâs sunken eyes
turned toward the inlet. âYou kin hear de motorboat
a long time âfore she come in sight.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm glad you told us what you did, Uncle
Mose,â said Kitty. âDonât you worry. Mr. Beeson
will never buy this island.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âTâank de Lawd! You tell young Massa I keep
de trusâ anâ look atter de place like he ask me to.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Brad was impatient to be off, and Kitty bent her
back to the oar as he pulled away from the little
harbor. Glancing at Uncle Mose before they turned
a point in the shore, she saw him waving his battered
felt hat at them and pointing straight across
the marsh.</p>

<p class='c011'>Instead of turning north by the way they had
come they headed for the tide-filled creeks that
cut the marshy wastelands into jig-saw patterns.
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>They could have used the motor for greater speed,
but Kitty knew the noise would carry for quite a
distance across the empty wastes. Not until they
had gone almost a mile up one of the winding
creeks did they pause behind the shelter of some
tall marsh grass.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHope we donât get stuck in here,â said Brad.
âTideâs so low.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut itâs already turned. Thatâs a help.â She
rubbed her tired hands together a moment and
said, âUncle Mose gave us an earful, didnât he?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll say!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âLooks as though thatâs the final piece to complete
the puzzle.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âMaybe and maybe not, Kit. Weâve got to catch
âem with the goods before we can really bring
conviction.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSure is risky for that poor old negro. Beeson
doesnât look like the kind of man who would hesitate
to put the old man out of the way if he interferes
with his plans.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâre right.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âMaybe we should have brought him away with
us just now.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh no, that would never do. Beeson would be
sure you were responsibleâafter what happened
at the troop train the other day.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI guess youâre right. That would make him cut
off his traffic with the Germans till suspicion dies
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>down.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âKit, itâs come to the point where we no longer
have a right to keep all this to ourselves.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou mean the FBI should know?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âCertainly. Itâs not mere surmise now. What
Uncle Mose told us bears out accurately the theories
weâve been forming.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâre right, Brad.â Even though they had
prided themselves on their discoveries so far, Kitty
had to admit that the affair was now too dangerous
for them to handle. She could never forgive herself
if, through their bungling, Uncle Mose lost
his life.</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut weâve got to get out of here first,â said
Brad. âItâs beginning to look as though weâre in for
a real blow, Kit.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âA real souâeaster.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly Brad half rose and peered above the
strip of marsh grass behind which they were hiding.
âListen, Kit, sounds like Beesonâs boat is
coming right in here.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âGood heavens! Whatâll we do?â</p>

<p class='c011'>She crawled over to the stern locker and hunted
for the field glasses. As she adjusted them she stood
in the boat and scanned the western horizon.
Finally she concentrated her gaze on a section of
the inlet near the pine bluff.</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo. He isnât in the marshes. Even with the
wind taking the sound from us, the bluff must be
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>a sort of sounding board to throw it back.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWeâll have to be carefulâwindâs blowing from
us to him,â cautioned Brad.</p>

<p class='c011'>She let Brad have the glasses and he watched
while Beeson towed the barge to the dock. âUncle
Mose is already there to carry the food scraps up
to the hogs,â he explained as he watched.</p>

<p class='c011'>âCan you see anything that looks like supplies
for the Germans?â she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>âNot at this distance.â</p>

<p class='c011'>He handed her the glasses and she watched until
Beeson went stomping up to the house in his knee
boots.</p>

<p class='c011'>Great masses of purple clouds boiled in the western
sky, while the tall marsh grass lay almost level
under the rushing wind.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWeâd better beat it for home!â exclaimed Kitty.
âLooks to me as if this is turning to a hurricane.â
On the Gulf coast she had often seen storms come
up like this in a very short time.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThere was a hurricane reported south of hereâguess
weâre getting an edge of the gale,â said
Brad.</p>

<p class='c011'>They debated whether to return to the inlet
with which they were familiar, but decided the
safest course would be to follow the marshy creek,
even thought it might take them longer to get
home. Brad still had the little map which he had
sketched in his billfold. They studied that, trying
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>to figure out the most direct route back to Palmetto
Island.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThis creek swings round mighty close to Mangrove
Island,â Kitty said dubiously.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs better than going too close to Terrapin
Island.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Acting upon their decision they picked up their
oars again. They were now moving against the
force of the rising tide and found progress slow.
They made several elbow turns and eventually
found themselves close enough to Mangrove Island
to make a landing, if they had so desired.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâve wanted to explore it ever since you boys
told me about seeing the boat in the mangroves
on the other side,â Kitty said.</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo time to explore now,â Brad stated rather
shortly. âIf I ever get you out of this saboteursâ
nest Iâll never bring you into the marshes againâtill
the warâs over.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty laughed. âIâm not afraid, Brad. Whatâs
there to be afraid of now?â</p>

<p class='c011'>Even as she spoke there came a pinging sound,
piercing and sharp above the howl of the wind.
Almost simultaneously Brad groaned and slapped
his hand to his shoulder as he toppled backward
into the bottom of the boat. The oar slipped from
his limp fingers and bobbed off on the tide.</p>

<p class='c011'>âLie down, Kit! Lie down!â he ordered even
as he fell.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>âBrad, are you hurt?â she wailed.</p>

<p class='c011'>With his right hand he seized her arm and
pulled her to the bottom of the boat beside him.
The hand was wet with blood from the wound in
his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe got me all right. But keep low! Donât lift
your head above the gunwale.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Two more shots came whistling across the boat.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWeâve got to get out of here!â stated Brad
desperately.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even if they had two oars to use Kitty knew it
would be suicide to sit up to row.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll start the motor,â she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>On her stomach she wiggled toward the motor.
At such a disadvantage she wondered if she could
get the engine going. But she must! There was
no other way for them to get away from that
shower of lead.</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut you canât see to steer,â said Brad. âWeâll
go headlong into the marsh.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWeâve got to take a chance. I have a general
idea of the channel beyond hereâpassed this way
the other day when Billy and I came here.â</p>

<p class='c011'>To Kittyâs infinite relief the starter responded
to her touch. The sound of that motor was only
an invitation to more shots. This time they were
aimed low, evidently with the hope of puncturing
the boatâs side and hitting them as they crouched
below the gunwale. But the lead spattered harmlessly
into the water.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>By holding the lower curve of the wheel, and
watching the tree-lined shore, Kitty could steer,
and give the motor as much speed as she dared.
When they had gone several yards, and just after
a fresh spatter of lead struck their stern, she took
a chance on lifting her eyes high enough for a
look ahead.</p>

<p class='c011'>Three more shots trailed them, but fell short
of the mark, and a few minutes later they felt
that they must be out of range. By the smudge of
smoke at their right Kitty knew they were now
passing the dump pile, with open, safer water
ahead. Not until then did she dare give the boat
any real speed.</p>

<p class='c011'>She glanced down and saw Bradâs face drawn and
white at her feet. Blood had run from his coat to
the bottom of the boat. Kitty rose from her crouching
position and saw a sheltering arm of marshland
ahead. When she rounded this so the boat
was hidden from Mangrove Island she cut off her
motor and bent over Brad. When she unbuttoned
his coat she found his shirt saturated with blood.</p>

<p class='c011'>âA little lower and it would have gone through
your heart,â she said anxiously. âWait, Iâll try to
stop that blood.â</p>

<p class='c011'>She was thankful her father always kept the
launch prepared for emergencies. They never went
out without field glasses, flashlights, a lantern, a
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>jug of water, tins of food and a first-aid kit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her deft fingers cut away the bloody clothes. She
cleaned the wound as best she could, then bound
it tightly to check the blood.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou seem to know how to do it,â he said
gratefully.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI took two first-aid courses at school, but havenât
had much chance to practice.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHope you donât have another chance like this
any time soon,â he said ruefully.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the blood checked Brad struggled to a sitting
position, his left arm lying limp in his lap.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou knew somebody was watching us before
the shot came,â said Kitty with conviction, recalling
his sudden anxiety to have her safely home.</p>

<p class='c011'>He nodded. âI didnât say anything. I didnât
want to frighten you. I thought it might be somebody
quite harmless.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âFar from it!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âKit, I thought I saw the blue of a sailorâs
uniform.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, then it wasnât Germans, hiding there till
Beeson came back?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI may have been mistaken about the clothes,
but anybody from the island could have seen us
watching Beeson go ashore at his dock.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs so,â Kitty admitted. âNo doubt they
have field glasses, too.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIt wasnât likely to be anybody from the U-boats.
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>Theyâd take too much risk coming ashore any
time but at night.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âA sailorâs uniform,â she repeated. âCould it
have been Punaro?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âItâs possible. Of course Cary wears blue, too.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut I thought you said Punaro always brought
the stuff out here in the early morning?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou forget this is Saturday afternoon. Heâs off,
too,â Brad reminded her.</p>

<p class='c011'>She realized then how ghastly white he had
grown. His lips had a bluish look, and he was
trembling slightly in the chill wind. She was
afraid of shock from the loss of blood, and hurried
back to her motor. She must take him to the
hospital as speedily as possible.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the time Kitty was in sight of the hospital
the storm had reached gale proportions, and even
the inland, sheltered waterways were whipped into
tumbling whitecaps.</p>

<p class='c011'>âShall I go straight to the unloading dock behind
the hospital?â she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>âAgainst regulations. Nothingâs supposed to
come ashore there but supplies.â</p>

<p class='c011'>She was afraid Brad couldnât walk to the hospital
from any of the small landing docks farther
east, but she decided he could wait in the boat
while she went to their house for the car.</p>

<p class='c011'>âItâll probably be better to go ashore somewhere
else anyhow,â she told him.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWish I didnât have to go back to the hospital
just now,â he said. âIf it gets around that I was
shot in the marshes, Lieutenant Cary will be sure
to hear about itâmay put a crimp in drawing a
noose around the criminalsâ necks.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy didnât I think of that before?â said Kitty.
âIâll take you to our house. Surely Dad will be
back from town by the time we get there. Heâll
know whatâs best to do.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>âI hate to be so much bother, but that does seem
the most sensible thing. You can phone Dr. Williams.
Heâs the closest friend I have among the
doctors. Heâll take care of the wound and keep
his mouth shut, too.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSure. Thatâs just what weâll do.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI donât have to report for duty till Monday.
Nobody will get curious about me till then.â</p>

<p class='c011'>When Kitty turned the bend in the channel and
rounded the point on which the hospital stood, she
thought she had never faced such a howling gale.
She glanced toward the island and saw that the
hurricane flag was flying.</p>

<p class='c011'>Brad ducked his head and clung to the seat.
Kitty anchored herself to the wheel, and steered
for the landing behind their cottage. Already
lights were twinkling along shore, though enough
twilight lingered for her to come in to the dock
without too much uncertainty.</p>

<p class='c011'>Never before had she attempted to make her
moorings in such a choppy sea. The stormy wind
had forced the rising tide up rapidly. She was
glad of this for it would spare Brad a climb to
the dock. She was afraid the force of the storm
would pound the launch against the pilings, so
she cut off their motor and with the remaining oar
worked toward the lee side of the dock. It took
all her skill to make any progress as she had to
move straight into the teeth of the rushing wind
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>that swept diagonally across the island. Brad was
powerless to help her, for his one hand was needed
to hold himself to the seat.</p>

<p class='c011'>âDonât try to help!â Kitty called to him, as he
started to crawl forward. âIâll make it. The least
little strain will start that place bleeding again.â</p>

<p class='c011'>In spite of her warning after Kitty got the boat
close enough Brad seized their line and tossed it
deftly over a hook on the dock. The rope creaked
and the boat quivered at the sudden restriction.</p>

<p class='c011'>âCan you make it up the ladder?â Kitty asked
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were only three or four steps to climb,
but even that would be a strain on Brad in his
weakened condition.</p>

<p class='c011'>âMaybe youâd better go ahead and give me a
hand,â he was forced to admit. âGuess Iâm no
good.â</p>

<p class='c011'>She hadnât realized how weak he was until she
tried to help him up that ladder. She had to pull
him by his good arm every step of the way. When
he reached the dock he collapsed at her feet. Desperately
she glanced toward the village, hoping for
help, but the storm had evidently driven everyone
to shelter. A small boat battled the gale half way
between them and the hospital, but the howling
wind would drown her call for help.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was afraid to leave him on the dock while
she went for help. The gale might grow strong
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>enough any minute to sweep him into the water.
There was danger of opening the wound again if
she tried to move him, but she had no choice. Carefully
she lifted his head against her knees, locked
her hands under his arms and dragged him down
the dock to the shelter of a twisted oak that grew
on the shell bank.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was already wet from the mist and spray
and now rain came in a sudden deluge. It mingled
with the tears streaming down her cheeks as she
ran the block and a half to her home. With a
thankful prayer she saw that the lights were on.
Jane, at least, must be there.</p>

<p class='c011'>âLet me in!â she called, actually pounding the
door with her fists.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jane swung the door in almost at once. âWhy,
Miss Kitty, you looks like a scarecrow!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIs Dad here?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYasâm. He sho is, anâ he just about on he haid
cause you ainât come home.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father was pulling on his raincoat as he
came out of his room.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy Kitty, whatâs wrong? Why are you so
late?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDad, we couldnât help it. Bradâs shot!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âShot?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âFrom the marshes.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhere is he now?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI got him ashore hereâbut couldnât bring him
any farther.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>âHeâs not dead?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, no! I mean I hope not. He must have
fainted when I was helping him to the dock. He
lost so much blood.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhich dock?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOursâbehind the house.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll get the car. Youâd better come, too, Jane.
I donât want Kitty to strain herself, helping me
lift him.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Billy was already in bed, so Mr. Carter closed
the door softly. âHeâll be all right. Weâll be back
in a few minutes. Iâll drop you two off here before
I take him on to the hospital.â</p>

<p class='c011'>He hurried out to get the car and Kitty followed
him saying, âBut we donât want to take him
to the hospital. He doesnât want them to know.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhat are you talking about, my child? Thatâs
the place for him.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNot under the circumstances, Dad.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty tumbled into the car beside him, and Jane
got into the back, praying aloud excitedly. Mr.
Carter started the motor and they raced out the
drive.</p>

<p class='c011'>âPlease do as I say, Dad,â persisted Kitty. âJust
this once, Dad. Thereâs no time to tell you everything,
but weâve learned things this afternoon that
may put a stop to all this awful business.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Carter made no reply for a moment, grimly
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>intent upon his driving in the rain. Finally he
said, âIâve been a fool, Kitty, to let you go ahead
and get into something like this.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty was too miserable over Brad to pay much
attention to her fatherâs rebuke. âThere, heâs
under the oak yonder,â she directed, when they
turned the corner and raced down the block.</p>

<p class='c011'>They found Brad had recovered consciousness,
and was sitting with his back propped against the
tree trunk.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSo silly of me to check out,â he apologized
when they approached him. âI figured youâd gone
for the car.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThink you can get in?â asked Mr. Carter.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSure,â Brad tried to make light of his weakness.</p>

<p class='c011'>But he was a dead weight on Mr. Carter as he
helped him to his feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>âGuess youâve lost a lot of blood, old boy.
Where did they hit you?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âJust under my shoulder blade. Kitty bound it
up, but Iâd spilled plenty before she got a chance
to do that.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty breathed easier when he was in the front
seat beside her father. She and Jane sat in the
back. Nothing more was said until Mr. Carter
stopped the car in front of their house, instead of
going into the drive.</p>

<p class='c011'>âJane, you get out and stay with Billy. Kitty,
you can come on up to the hospital with us if
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>youâd rather.â</p>

<p class='c011'>There were tears in Kittyâs voice when she
wailed, âBut Dad, we donât want them to know
about this at the hospital!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThis is no time to think of such things, Kitty.
Itâs quite evident Brad will need a blood transfusion.
The hospital is the proper place for that.â</p>

<p class='c011'>When Jane got out and her father drove on toward
the hospital Kitty couldnât keep the tears
back. What a mess she had made of the whole business!
If she had known Brad must go to the hospital
it would have been so much easier to stop at
the supply dock, regulations or no regulations.
Now everybody at the hospital would know, anyhow,
that he had been shot. How the talk would
fly from mouth to mouth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even if Punaro wasnât the guilty party he would
learn about it. If he was really in league with
Beeson he, in turn, would get the facts, and surmise
that they had visited Terrapin Island again.
In that event she feared for Uncle Moseâs safety.
But after all, she thought finally, what did any of
this matter compared with Bradâs welfare?</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father had a stretcher brought down to take
Brad to the emergency room. As Kitty followed
into the hospital she said, âDad, if Bradâs blood is
type one Iâll be glad to give him blood for a transfusion.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father turned and flashed her a smile.
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>âThanks, Kitten. But I think we have a generous
supply of all types here. Iâll go on to the emergency
room and see what his condition is.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, Dad, I donât think I can stand it if Brad
dies. Itâs all my fault. I was the one who suggested
going out there today.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âStop blaming yourself, my child, for everything
that goes wrong!â</p>

<p class='c011'>He took a key from his pocket. âHereâs the key
to my office. Wait up there where itâs quiet. Iâll
come up later and tell you how Brad isâand I
want to hear all about what happened.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty was glad he had thought of this, for her
wet clothes and troubled face would certainly invite
questions from any friends who might see her.
She hurried out to the wing and up the steps to
the second floor, instead of taking the elevator.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had never been in the administrative wing
at night when everyone was off duty. There was
light in only one office as she went down the short
hall on the upper floor. Strangely enough she felt
more nervous there than she had in the lonely
marshes before the shooting. She was tempted to
turn back and go to Hazelâs room, but she knew
that would invite questions and call for explanations,
for which she was in no mood at the moment.
In her fatherâs office she could be quiet to
calm herself after so much excitement and strain.</p>

<p class='c011'>She unlocked the door and touched the light
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>button. She crossed to her fatherâs desk chair and
sat down a moment. She felt she couldnât live
through this interval while waiting to hear about
Brad. To divert her mind she reached for a book
in a rack at the back of the desk. It proved to be
a medical tome, whose language seemed dry as
dust to her excited mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the basket at the right of the desk were some
addressed envelopes and a stack of orders that had
been made up and signed by her father, but had
not yet been mailed. Her eyes ran down the list of
drugs and supplies that had been ordered.</p>

<p class='c011'>While sitting there she suddenly shivered, and
realized her clothes were wet through. Noticing
one of her fatherâs coats hanging on a rack in the
corner, she put it on, and went to the big armchair
near the window. She took off her wet shoes and
socks and tucked her feet under her woollen skirt
until they were warm.</p>

<p class='c011'>The chair faced the window and as she sat there
she recalled that her father had pointed out the
location of Mangrove Island from that very window.
How long ago it seemed! She wondered if
Punaro, or whoever had shot at them, was still out
there.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wind shook the window as it came howling in
from the sea. The rain had stopped, however, and
Kitty wondered if she could see anything across
the marshes at night. She padded across the office
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>on bare feet and switched off the light. While her
eyes became accustomed to the darkness she sat on
the window ledge peering out, wondering if the
Nazi spies would dare come ashore in such a storm
to pick up their loot. Would anyone be so foolhardy?</p>

<p class='c011'>The night was impenetrably black under lowering
clouds. She could see nothing except the glow
at the Marine Base to the east, and a few house
lights in the settlement around the hospital.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then anxiety for Brad swept over her again.
There was no use trying to think of anything else.
Unhappily she sank back into the leather chair.
She pulled her fatherâs coat closer about her, sat
on her feet again and was soon comfortably warm.
The wind came in from the sea like giant breakers
rolling up a beach. It crashed against the big
building, then there would be a momentary lull
before the next gust came. To Kittyâs alarm, now
that she paused to listen, each blast seemed worse
than the one that had just struck. As soon as she
heard from Brad they would go back to the cottage
for Billy and Jane. She had been through
too many storms on the Gulf coast to feel safe in a
small house on a night like this.</p>

<p class='c011'>Under the circumstances it didnât seem possible
she could have dozed, but Kitty came to herself
with a start at the sound of a key in the door.
Instantly she was on the alert. Her father had given
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>her his key. If it were he, she thought, he
would have rapped and called to her to let him in.
Cautiously she crouched deeper in the leather chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the door swung inward noiselessly she saw
by the light from the hall a tall familiar form step
into the room. He closed the door softly, then
switching on a flash he moved quickly toward the
desk. As the flashlight circled about the desk top
for a moment it tilted so that reflected illumination
struck the sneakâs face. Her surmise had been
correct; it was Lieutenant Cary.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the dark corner the terrified girl watched
breathlessly. Her eyes were just above the chair
back, as Cary examined the order blanks in the
large basket on the desk. Apparently finding what
he wanted, he took up the sheaf of papers and buttoned
them under his coat.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty was almost beside herself with terror. So it
was really Cary who did the underhand business
that got both the Chief Pharmacistâs Mates into
trouble. She couldnât let him get away with it.
But what in the world could she do in her defenseless
position?</p>

<p class='c011'>Lieutenant Cary was almost at the door when,
without any premeditation, Kitty found herself
saying in the fiercest tone she could command,
âDonât move another step, Lieutenant Cary, or Iâll
shoot!â</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c000' />

<div id='dontmoveor'  class='figcenter id021'>

  <h2 id='trapped' class='c002'><span class='large'>CHAPTER NINETEEN</span><br />Â <br /><span class='large'>TRAPPED</span></h2>

<p class='c010'>The instant Kitty made that threat she was appalled
at her daring. Lieutenant Cary might have
a pistol and fire in her direction in the darkness.
Terrified she crouched in the chair. Cary didnât
move or speak for what seemed an eternity. Then
she heard an almost imperceptible rattle of paper.
He must be trying to slide those orders from under
his coat, to remove the evidence of his guilt.</p>

<p class='c011'>âLeave those papers under your coat!â she
ordered.</p>

<p class='c011'>The paper rattling ceased. Then suddenly she
caught the sound of footsteps in the hall. It would
do no good for her to scream and call for help.
Anyone passing down the hall was not likely to
have a key that would fit this door. She couldnât
forget that Cary might have a gun. But would he
dare use it with someone in hearing?</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty decided this was the best moment for
action. Her bare feet made no sound as she glided
across the floor. If she could only reach the door
while someone else was near she might have a
chance. Even after having been in darkness for
quite a while her dilated eyes could distinguish
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>little in the room. No doubt their surroundings
were still more veiled to Cary.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had only reached the back of the desk when
she heard a key slip into the door lock. Relief
flooded over her in a great wave, only to be followed
by stark terror at what Cary might do if her
father came in and found him here.</p>

<p class='c011'>The door swung in and the light flashed up.
Almost at the same moment Cary hurled himself
at Chief Carter. The impact was so completely
unexpected that Carter was thrown back against
the partly open door, and it closed with a bang.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSo, itâs you, Cary!â exclaimed Mr. Carter, even
as he went down.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty seized Caryâs coat as he made a lunge at
her father. A moment later she realized that someone,
who had been coming here with her father,
had been shut out by the banging door. He was
now pounding it impatiently. Kitty sprang to
open it, and a blue-uniformed officer, whom she
had never seen before, rushed to her fatherâs aid.
Fortunately he was armed, and a minute later had
backed Cary into a corner. The order sheets from
Chief Carterâs desk had slipped from under the
physicianâs coat and were scattered over the floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father got to his feet and faced the officer.
âWell, Captain Rogers, this is a bit of luck!â</p>

<p class='c011'>The Captain laughed shortly, without shifting
his gaze from Cary. âWe scarcely dared hope to
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>catch him in the act.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI expect weâll have to give credit for the catching
to my daughter,â replied Chief Carter, glancing
proudly at Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHow did you manage it, young lady?â asked the
severe-looking Captain.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty thought how terrified she would be to face
him at a trial. He had the look of a man whose
dealings with law-breakers had soured him on the
world.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI must confess I didnât do any managing,â Kitty
admitted ruefully. âI was sitting here waiting
for Dad when in came Lieutenant Cary.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWaiting in the dark?â her father asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI turned off the light to watch the stormâsee
what I could see outside,â Kitty floundered.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSoâhe didnât realize anyone was in here?â
asked the officer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kittyâs excited breath caught in her throat a moment
before she could explain, âHe went straight
to Dadâs desk with a flashlight, and picked up those
order sheets.â She pointed to the papers strewn
over the floor. âHe stuffed them under his coat.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe must have come just as he did that,â surmised
her father.</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo! It seemed an eternity. I told him not to
move or Iâd shoot.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut Kitty, you had no gun!â exclaimed her father.
âWhy do you take such foolhardy chances,
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>my child?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThen you came! I was going to try to get out
the door while someone was passing. I didnât dare
hope it was you.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Though Captain Rogers hadnât taken his eyes off
Cary for a moment, Kitty saw the shadow of a smile
twitch around the straight lines of his mouth.
Then he spoke suddenly, âMr. Carter, please phone
Minger to come up with some handcuffs. Our Lieutenant
here looks like a volcano that may erupt at
any moment. No doubt itâs bitter for him to
know he has been caught by this alert young lady.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Cary, at bay in the corner, seemed turned to
stone. His baleful glances had swept from one to
the other as they spoke, but otherwise not a muscle
of his face changed to betray his real feelings. No
doubt the Nazis had trained him so well, that to
die for the Fuehrer, in an attempt to serve him,
was a coveted sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Petty Officer with the handcuffs came up
in an amazingly short time, Kitty thought. He, too,
was a stranger to her. When the irons had been
snapped over the physicianâs wrists Captain Rogers
said, âTake him away, Minger. Iâll join you later.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Lieutenant Caryâs head was held high as he
walked out. His only act of defiance was to step
deliberately on the scattered order blanks.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty could scarcely wait for the door to close
before she asked, âOh, Dad, tell me about Brad.
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>Is he going to be all right?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe hope so, Kitten,â her father replied gently.
âThe wound isnât so bad. The bullet was extracted
without too much trouble, and no bones were
shattered.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe lost so much blood before I could do anything
for him,â she said with regret.</p>

<p class='c011'>âHis strength will come back as soon as he has
a transfusion.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, Dad, itâs all been so awful!â wailed Kitty.
Suddenly she threw her arms over his shoulders
and burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father held her to him a moment consolingly.
âThis last experience was a little too much,
eh, Kitten?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI just knew he was going to kill you the minute
you opened that door!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWell, he didnât! Letâs hope the worst is over
now.â Mr. Carter went toward a cabinet in the corner.
âIâm going to fix you a small dose of medicine
to calm your nerves.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, Iâll be all right in a moment.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo, youâd better take this,â her father insisted.
âYouâll need it to fortify you. We still have much
to talk about. Captain Rogers may want to ask you
some questions.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy? Is heââ</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes. Heâs the man I sent for when you told
me all you had uncovered the other day.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>Kitty felt rather stunned at this information, yet
relieved, too. She would be glad to get the whole
business off her mind, and all this information into
responsible hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Rogers had gathered the scattered papers
and was examining them while Kitty drank the
medicine and let her father lead her again to the
big armchair. He placed two other chairs close,
then found an old sweater and wrapped it around
his daughterâs bare feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou mustnât get chilled after such a trying
day,â he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he joined Captain Rogers at his desk and
they stood conferring in low tones for a few minutes.
Gradually Kitty began to feel relaxed, and
infinitely relieved that the suspense of these last
weeks had at last reached a climax. She was now
impatient to talk over everything with her father
and his superior officer. There was much she
wanted to know, too.</p>

<p class='c011'>âFeeling better?â asked her father, coming back
and standing by her chair. He took the damp kerchief
from her head, and ran his fingers through
her tumbled curls.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, much!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWell, suppose you tell us what happened this
afternoon when you and Brad went out to Terrapin
Island.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Rogers came over and sat astride a
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>straight chair, his arms folded over the back as he
faced her. This informality instantly put Kitty at
her ease, while she gave a detailed account of her
afternoon up to the time she had brought Brad
home.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYoung lady, you have shown remarkable keenness
in handling this situation,â said the Captain.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty flushed. âOh, no. Iâve made lots of mistakes.
You donât know.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, yes, I do,â he retorted. âYour father has
told me everything up to date. However, I must
admit you made one mistake in the very beginning.â</p>

<p class='c011'>She met his piercing brown eyes squarely. âI
know,â she nodded. âI should have reported my
very first suspicions to the FBI.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âExactly! No sensitive young lady should attempt
to deal with Nazi or Jap saboteurs.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut I was afraid to tell anyone until they had
been maneuvered into a position where they could
really be caught.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Rogers laughed unexpectedly. âShe
doesnât have a very high regard for the secret investigators
of her country, eh, Carter?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, I donât mean it that way!â Kitty hastened
to apologize. âBut you see from the very beginning
IâI was afraid that somehow this officeâDadâs
officeâwas involved. One doesnât run to the FBI
about things where oneâs father may be concerned.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>Captain Rogers glanced significantly at the
Chief Pharmacistâs Mate. âWell, Carter, I suppose
that puts a stop to my scolding.â He suddenly
grew serious again as he turned to Kitty to say,
âYoung lady, if you had known what perfect confidence
we have in this dad of yours you would
have had no fears. When we sent him here we
knew he was the one man who could stop the dirty
business going onâif anyone could.â</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Chief Carterâs turn to look surprised. âBut
I asked to be sent here!â he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Rogers laughed. âYou were only one
step ahead of us. We had planned to ask you to
take this post in hopes of clearing up the trouble.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThen you knew the fault was not in this office?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âCertainly.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut you dumped Chief Dawson down in Santiago.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThat was only a blind to throw the guilty
parties off the track until we could pin the goods
on them. Dawson understands all that, but is
pledged to secrecy.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWell, for goodness sake!â burst forth Kitty. âIf
Iâd had any idea of all that I would have told
everything long ago.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIf several people had had an idea of all this we
might never have sprung this trap,â explained
Captain Rogers.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou speak as if it were really sprung,â said
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>Kitty eagerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIt isâpractically.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIt seems rather certain that Punaro is responsible
for young Brad Masonâs wound. He was away
from the hospital all afternoon. Iâll order his
arrest shortly. As for Beeson, heâs practically a prisoner
on that island until this blow is over. Weâll
be prepared to handle him as soon as we can get
out there.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou wonât let anything happen to poor Uncle
Mose?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWeâll do our best. The old darky is certainly
entitled to his reward, too, in opening your eyes
to so much.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut there are others. Brad thinks one of the
ward attendants may be helping, too.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, yes. They figure they have a perfect set-up,â
said Captain Rogers. âFirst they put the incinerator
out of order to make an opening for
traffic into the marshes. Lieutenant Cary, with the
assistance of your fatherâs stenographerââ</p>

<p class='c011'>âDadâs stenographer?â exclaimed Kitty, completely
shocked.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI was just as surprised as you, Kitten, when that
amazing fact dawned on me,â explained Mr. Carter.
âMiss Dales seemed such a quiet, clinging vine
sort I couldnât feature her daring to mix in anything
like this.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhy, Dad, I canât believe it! She acted as
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>though she would do anything in the world for
you.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âShe had been Dawsonâs secretary, so I thought
surely she was all right.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWe were rather relieved you kept her on,â put
in Rogers. âWe had our suspicions of her all along.
Any change might have put them too much on the
alert.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIf you hadnât given me a hint about her, Captain
Rogers,â said Carter, âI might not have
thought of setting this trap tonight. We finished
up these order sheets just before I left the office
and I told her to mail them.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âInstead she left them where Cary could get
them tonightâas she has done numberless times
before, so he could add his order for medicine for
the German subs, above your signature.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âExactly!â said Mr. Carter.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSo thatâs why thereâs been so much suspicion
about the orders that go in,â said Kitty. âBut how
has Lieutenant Cary been getting hold of the
extra supplies when they come back?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThe shipments are carried to Caryâs office.
Thatâs in the normal routine. It is a very simple
matter for him to take out the extra things he
has ordered. Punaro, in collecting rubbish, places
the supplies intended for German subs under the
trash in his dump cart, and later hides it aboard
the rubbish barge.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>âAnd Beeson?â asked Kitty. âYou really think
heâs the middleman?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo doubt of that,â replied Captain Rogers.
âHe probably carts off quite a bit of fresh food
with him when he comes for scraps for his hogs.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs just what we figured,â said Kitty. âAnd
I suppose Hazel Dawson was right about Lieutenant
Cary playing chess with Krome to keep him
occupied while Punaro gets away with the dirty
work in the galley?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo doubt thatâs been his program.â</p>

<p class='c011'>While they had been talking, the fury of the
wind had increased. Mr. Carter kept glancing uneasily
toward the rattling windows.</p>

<p class='c011'>âCaptain, if youâll excuse me I think Iâd better
go back to our bungalow and bring my little boy
and his nurse here. This wind is reaching an
alarming force.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes, yes, of course! They say itâs likely to
reach hurricane proportions by morning.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Carter got up quickly. âIâm afraid itâs
going to be ahead of schedule. Our small cottage
is no place to spend the night.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty threw aside the old sweater and jumped
to her feet, frightened for Billy.</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo, dear, youâd better not come with me. No
use for you to get wet again,â said her father.
âYouâve been through enough for one day. Hazel
is on night duty. You can get some sleep in her
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>room.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes, young lady, you mustnât take any more
chances. We may need you here in the morning
anyhow to answer further questions.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâll stop by and tell Hazel youâre going to her
room,â said her father when they started out. âIâll
arrange for Billy and Jane somehow here. Restrictions
will be let down for such an emergency.
So you just put everything out of your mind and
get some sleep.â</p>

  <h2 id='rewards' class='c002'><span class='large'>CHAPTER TWENTY</span><br />Â <br /><span class='large'>REWARDS</span></h2>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Carterâs orders for Kitty to put all worries
out of her mind and sleep, were easier given than
followed. She knew that very well as she entered
Hazelâs room. She thought a hot bath would do her
more good than anything else. There were plenty
of fresh towels on the rack in the bathroom, and
Kitty was sure her friend would want her to make
herself at home. She was just rubbing down after
a relaxing soak, when she heard someone come in.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThat you, Hazel?â she called.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes. Your dad told me you were here. I came
as soon as I could get away.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âCould you lend me some pajamas? I helped
myself to a bath.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYouâre more than welcome, darling. Iâll get
you something to sleep in.â</p>

<p class='c011'>A moment later a pair of flowered pajamas were
thrust inside the bathroom door. When Kitty came
out arrayed in the sleeping garments two sizes too
large for her, Hazel had the cover already turned
down on the bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou hop right in, and Iâll tuck you up for the
night.â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>âYouâre an angel to let me rest here.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âItâs a privilege. The hospital will be jammed
tonight.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI wonât feel easy till Billy and Jane are safely
in. Where do you suppose theyâll sleep?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYour father is having a cot put in his own
room for Billy. Jane will sleep in the maidsâ quarters.
Theyâre putting up cots in the recreation
room and library for other people. Everyone on
the island has been ordered to take refuge in the
larger buildings. They say none of the cottages
will be safe by morning.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThereâll be lots for the Canteen workers to do
after this.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSo youâd better stretch out there and get some
sleep. But first drink this warm milk I brought
you. Your father said youâd had no supper.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kittyâs heart swelled with gratitude. âYouâre a
dear, Hazel. I love you very much.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Hazel suddenly put down the cup of milk and
sat on the side of the bed, catching Kittyâs hands
in hers. âAnd I love you very much, too, darling.
Itâll be wonderful to have a daughter like you.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Surprised, Kitty asked, âYou meanâyou really
meanâ?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âYes. I mean your father and I have planned to
marry as soon as we could clear up this trouble.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, Hazel, I <i>am</i> delighted!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe had only a moment just now to whisper
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>that the worst is over, and that you helped bring
it about.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kittyâs eyes were shining. âThereâs so much to
talk about I donât think I can sleep. If I could only
know Bradâs going to be all right Iâd be too happy
for words.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut you must sleep, dear. Your father said
youâve been through awful things and must rest.
Here, drink this milk and go to sleep. Iâll come
in as soon as you wake up and tell you how Brad is.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty drank the milk while Hazel stood beside
her bed. As she handed her the cup she said softly,
âItâll seem almost like having my own mother
again, Hazel, to have you.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Quick tears welled in her friendâs eyes. âNothing
you could have said would make me feel more
welcome, Kitten.â With a quick movement Hazel
brushed the tears aside and said, âNow I must
hurry back to my ward. Iâll see you in the
morning.â</p>

<p class='c011'>As Kitty settled down on the pillow she had no
idea she could sleep. Even if her mind had not
been so full of things to think about the howling
wind was enough to keep anyone awake. She had
not realized how utterly weary she was until she
sank into that soft bed. The bath and the warm
milk seemed to have magic effect, for almost at
once she felt drowsy and soon slept.</p>

<hr class='pb c000' />

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>When she roused the shades were drawn, but
she could see it was day. The wind was still blowing,
but not with such fury as when she had gone
to sleep. She glanced at the bedside clock and was
shocked to see it was eleven-thirty. Hazel should
have long since had her turn in the bed. When
she sat up she saw her two suitcases on the floor,
all stuck over with labels from her college days.
Dear old Dad, he thought of everything. At least
she would now have something to wear if their
cottage had blown down during the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her first thought on waking had been of Brad.
How had he fared through the night? She found
her yellow and blue plaid skirt and a blue sweater
among the things her father had brought. She had
dressed and was just brushing her hair when she
heard someone at the door and turned to see Hazel.</p>

<p class='c011'>âI feel terrible that I slept so late!â Kitty exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm delighted you could sleep. I put just a bit
of sleeping powder in that milk last night. I was
sure youâd need it.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, you did! Guess I wouldnât have slept without
it. My mind was in such a turmoil. Howâs
Brad?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âMuch better. He wants to see you as soon as
you wake. Room eighteen, third floor.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, Iâm so relieved.â Kitty gave a final flip to
her hair, and turned to Hazel. âYou look fresh as
ever. Where did you sleep?â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>âOh, I had a good rest in Elsieâs room while she
was on duty.â She sat down near the window.
âYour dad and I had a long talk over our breakfast.
He told me everything. Youâve been a wonder,
Kitty.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut I wonât feel easy till Punaro and Beeson
are captured. Did they arrest Punaro last night?â</p>

<p class='c011'>Hazel shook her head. âNo, he didnât come in.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSeems no doubt he was the one who shot Brad.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThe FBI have gone out now in a powerful
motorboat. The wind is down enough for them to
take a chance. Theyâre afraid to wait too long for
fear the pair will get away.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDid the storm do much damage on the island?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI hate to tell you how much, dear. You can get
a view of the destruction from Bradâs room.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty was instantly alert. âThen weâll need every
Canteen worker on the island. I must try to get
in touch with Mrs. Evans. I suppose all the wires
are down.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, yes. But Mrs. Evans and her family slept in
the recreation hall. She asked me to tell you to
report to the USO as soon as possible.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âGlad to know it weathered the blow.â</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitty couldnât go anywhere until she saw for
herself how Brad was. The nurse was just propping
him up for his dinner as Kitty entered.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSurely is grand to see you eating, Brad!â she
said happily when she went in.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>Though his left arm was bound against his body
he could feed himself with his right hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThat transfusion put the kick right back into
me,â Brad said. âSorry I was such a nuisance last
night.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âDonât be silly!â</p>

<p class='c011'>She followed the nurse to the door and closed
it tightly. âBrad, the whole thing came to a climax
last night. Feel able to hear about it?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âSorry you donât get the privilege, Kit, but Chief
Carter and Captain Rogers were in here a couple
of hours ago. They told me everything. Youâve
really been super through it all.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âIâm glad they talked with you. Hazel told me
theyâve gone out to Terrapin Island now to get
Beeson and Punaro. Sure hope no harm comes
to Uncle Mose before they get there.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHope so, too. We can use the old darky when
we build our summer cottage in the pine thicket.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOur summer cottage in the pine thicket!â exclaimed
Kitty and laughed suddenly. âOh, Brad,
what a dreamer you are! They must have you sort
of doped still.â</p>

<p class='c011'>But he was entirely himself as he looked at her
seriously. âReally, Kit, wouldnât you like that?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI think I would, Brad,â she replied just as
seriously. âBut weâve an awful lot to do first.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, of course. Weâve got to finish this big job!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd I canât stay here long now. Thereâs work
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>to be done down yonder.â</p>

<p class='c011'>She moved toward the window as she spoke. A
few blocks away she could see where the storm
had struck with full force. It looked as though a
giant mowing machine might have laid everything
level in its path.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, our cottage is ruined!â she burst forth.</p>

<p class='c011'>âSorry, Kit. Your dad told me about it.â</p>

<p class='c011'>How happy they had been there, she thought.
But, of course, they had owned neither the house
nor the furniture, so their loss was nothing to
compare with that of many others near by. And
they would be needing her services right now.
There were many hungry mouths to feed and she
must hurry off to her Canteen work. This was no
time to dream of a bright future or stop to talk
over a troubled past.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few minutes later she ate a hasty lunch with
her father and Billy before she put on her Canteen
uniform to report for duty at the USO. The wind
was still too high for them to feed the homeless
outdoors, so the hall was turned into an emergency
dining-room. Kitty worked hard all day and until
the last dish was washed that night. It was almost
twelve oâclock when she finally returned to the
hospital to get a few hoursâ sleep in Hazelâs bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was roused next morning by Hazel standing
by her bed. âIâm going to have breakfast with your
father. Wouldnât you like to come along?â</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>âYes, indeed!â Kitty was out of bed with a
bound, and soon had on her clothes. âAnything
develop while I was away yesterday?â she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>âVery satisfactory development. They got Beeson
all right.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHow about Uncle Mose?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe was quite safe in his cabin, so they left
him there.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThatâs a relief! What about Punaro?â</p>

<p class='c011'>âHe wasnât on Terrapin Island, or Mangrove
either. Thereâs a possibility his boat went down in
the storm, when he tried to return hereâor perhaps
get to Terrapin Island. They found the rifle.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThe rifle!â exclaimed Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âThe one that shot the slug into Brad. It was
in a cache on Mangrove Island along with several
boxes of medicine and hospital supplies. The stuff
all bore Punaroâs fingerprints.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThe gun, too?â</p>

<p class='c011'>Hazel nodded. âThe whole set-up seems quite
clear now,â she continued. âThe Germans have
evidently been coming in as far as Mangrove Island
in their rubber boat. There they change to different
clothes and an old bateau kept hidden in the mangroves,
in case they meet anyone on their way to
Terrapin.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âThe same boat the boys found in the mangroves,
I suppose.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNo doubt it was. They found enormous supplies
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>of canned goods and other foods stored at
Beesonâs place.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âMakes me shiver now that I really know what
chances we took,â said Kitty, when they were
ready to go down.</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd well you may shiver, my child. Itâs a
miracle you came through it with a whole skin.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âPoor Brad didnât.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, Bradâll be all right. Heâs going to have
breakfast with us.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNot really!â</p>

<p class='c011'>A few minutes later they found her father, Brad
and Billy waiting for them in the dining-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWhat a wonderful family reunion!â exclaimed
Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>When they had been served Chief Carter leaned
across the table and skid to his daughter, âKitten,
I have a nice surprise for you.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, Dad, I donât know if I can stand any more.
First we nip this saboteur business in the bud,
then I hear that you and Hazel are going to be
married, andâand Brad talks deliriously about
building us a summer home in the pines on
Terrapin Island.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âNow itâs our turn to be surprised, isnât it,
Hazel?â exclaimed her father.</p>

<p class='c011'>âWell, not exactly. My eyes have been open for
quite a while.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âBut now you talk of another surprise,â said
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>Kitty.</p>

<p class='c011'>âAnd this includes you both,â said Chief Carter,
suddenly growing serious again. âCaptain Rogers
has just told me that you both will be given
service awards, for special help to your country.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, Dad, not really!â</p>

<p class='c011'>âI didnât do anything but get shot!â exclaimed
Brad, but Kitty could see a slight color rising in his
pale cheeks.</p>

<p class='c011'>âYou did so! I couldnât have done anything
without you.â</p>

<p class='c011'>âWell, we wonât have any argument over that.
Youâre both entitled to recognition,â stated Chief
Carter.</p>

<p class='c011'>âOh, Dad, Iâm so thrilled! Iâve wanted so to
help, but I never dreamed it would turn out like
this.â</p>
